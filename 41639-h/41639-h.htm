made several voyages to Australia, I have often been asked how I
managed to relieve the monotony of so long a period on the
water.&nbsp; I have never felt this monotony, simply because on
each occasion I have set myself something to do.</p>
<p>In Mr. Trevelyan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Lord Macaulay&rdquo;
it is stated that when returning from India, that statesman set
himself the task of mastering the German language, and
accomplished it during the voyage.&nbsp; I did not attempt
anything so ambitious, but during my last voyage I occupied the
time in writing the following pages; and as they were written
under many difficulties, I feel I may confidently rely upon the
indulgence of those who may do me the honour of reading them.</p>

<p>It is commonly supposed by landsmen that the perils of ocean
travelling are much greater than those encountered upon
land.&nbsp; For my own part, I believe that, once on the open
sea, there is no pleasanter or safer mode of locomotion than is
to be found in a well-appointed sailing ship or steamer.&nbsp; I
certainly was in much greater danger of being drowned while
travelling on the railway between Bristol and Plymouth upon one
occasion than I have ever known myself to be while on board ship.
The autumn had been exceedingly wet, and the low-lying districts
in Somersetshire had become flooded, causing the railway to be
completely submerged for a distance of about three miles.&nbsp;
The water reached to the floors of the railway carriages, while
the locomotive in its progress made a great wave in front of <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>the
train.&nbsp; The wheels of the locomotive were 8ft. 10in. in
height, and the fire-box was 6ft. above the ground.&nbsp; Boats
accompanied the train on either side during its passage through
the water.&nbsp; Certainly I have never felt in so much danger in
the 60,000 miles of ocean travelling which I have had since
then.&nbsp; Not that there are no dangers to be met with on the
water, as I found to my alarm before I had fairly commenced my
last voyage.</p>
<p>Our vessel lay three miles off the Hoe, at Plymouth, and we
had engaged a large sailing boat to take us on board.&nbsp; When
we had got half way to the ship, and had lost the shelter of the
land, a fierce squall struck the sail and turned the boat over on
its side, throwing us into a confused heap on its bottom.&nbsp;
The boatman tried to lower the sail, but having tied it in a fast
knot he could not do so, and had no means of cutting the
rope.&nbsp; The rain came down pitilessly all the time, and the
waves dashed over us, drenching us to the skin, darkness coming
on in the meantime.&nbsp; For a few moments we almost gave
ourselves up as lost, but fortunately the violence of the wind
lessened, the boat righted itself, and we got alongside our ship,
but were unable in the darkness and the rush of the water and the
noise of the wind and rain to make ourselves heard.&nbsp; My
companion and I had to climb up the rope-ladder attached to the
ship, and to scramble over its side as best we could, in the
confusion altogether forgetting to take leave of our friends who
were in the boat below, and who were lost to sight the instant we
got on to the deck.</p>
<p>On entering the saloon the contrast was very great.&nbsp; The
big ship riding at anchor was as steady as the land <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>we had just
left.&nbsp; The saloon was brilliantly lighted; and the
passengers who had joined the ship at Gravesend were sitting
round the table engaged in various occupations; some were reading
or writing, while others were playing at whist, or were engaged
in conversation.&nbsp; Being new arrivals, there was considerable
curiosity to see which cabin we should call our own.</p>
<p>To a man taking his first voyage the phrase
&ldquo;cabin&rsquo;d, cribb&rsquo;d, confin&rsquo;d&rdquo; is at
once understood as he surveys the cabin, a portion of which is to
be his home for a month or two.&nbsp; The first feeling is that
it will be impossible to bestow all his belongings in the limited
space at his disposal, but before he has been long on board
things settle down into their places, and he almost begins to
wonder what he shall do with all the room.</p>
<p>The first night on board ship is generally one of great
confusion.&nbsp; The passengers seem to be in everybody&rsquo;s
way; but immediately after leaving port the baggage is stowed
away, the purser allots the seats at table, and everything goes
on with the greatest regularity.</p>
<p>The passengers on board one of the great Australian ships form
a perfect epitome of the great world ashore.&nbsp; The line of
division is sharply drawn between the various sets or
cliques.&nbsp; Many never condescend to notice numbers of their
fellow-passengers during the whole voyage; but for the most part
fraternisation becomes general after the first fortnight has
passed.</p>
<p>A three months&rsquo; voyage often enables a man to form a
juster appreciation of the character of his fellow-passengers
than many years&rsquo; residence in the same <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>neighbourhood
would do on shore; hence it often happens that life-friendships
of the warmest kind are formed on board ship.&nbsp; On steamers
bound for the Colonies representatives of almost every class are
to be found.&nbsp; Judges returning to their duties after a
holiday all too short; colonial statesmen with sufficient time on
their hands to allow of their formulating a policy to meet every
conceivable combination among their parliamentary opponents; and
squatters and merchants returning to the Colonies to look after
their property or their business.&nbsp; These men are generally
very much preoccupied, and their only anxiety appears to be to
get as speedily as possible to their destination.</p>
<p>Another class is composed of clergymen and professional men
taking a holiday, and generally speaking with every sign of great
enjoyment; while two other classes are largely
represented&mdash;viz., invalids in search of health, and young
ne&rsquo;er-do-wells sent to the Colonies under the mistaken idea
of their being more likely to reform in a new country.&nbsp; The
latter class is mainly composed of young fellows who have never
been brought up to any trade or calling at home, and who, with
their friends, seem to think that the Colonies are a sort of
&ldquo;Tom Tiddler&rsquo;s ground,&rdquo; where they can
&ldquo;pick up gold and silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These youths are sent out by their friends as a last chance,
under what is known as the &ldquo;private convict system,&rdquo;
and I believe that a very small proportion of them ever take a
position of respectability after landing in the Colonies.&nbsp;
Nor is it to be wondered at, for on the principle of &ldquo;birds
of a feather,&rdquo; etc., these young men get together on the
outward voyage, and all their <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>previous vices become much intensified
by the association.&nbsp; On the other hand, many young men of
good character, going out to the Colonies in search of
employment, and showing by their conduct during the voyage that
they are self-respecting, and consequently trustworthy, have
secured good appointments from colonial merchants before leaving
the ship.</p>
<p>Those who take the voyage on account of impaired health mainly
consist of men suffering from overwork, and invalids more or less
affected with pulmonary disease.&nbsp; In the case of the former
a long voyage is the surest remedy; and for those in the earliest
stage of consumption it is generally found to be efficacious; but
it would be impossible to devise a more cruel fate for such as
are thoroughly affected by that fell disease than to send them
out on a long voyage.&nbsp; The conditions are all against them;
the draught in the saloon is always great, and there is a total
absence of those little comforts and delicacies which consumptive
patients so greatly need, and the lack of which is so sorely
felt.&nbsp; Doctors who have never made a voyage little think to
what a miserable fate they are dooming their consumptive patients
when they order them to take a sea voyage.&nbsp; In five cases
out of six these patients are sent out too late, and the voyage
only hastens their inevitable end, while, if they had only been
sent in the earliest stages of the disease, they would almost
certainly have been restored.</p>
<p>I started on my first Australian voyage on a lovely day in the
late autumn.&nbsp; The sun was shining brilliantly, and as there
was very little wind we fondly hoped we should cross the Bay of
Biscay without having to go <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>through the disagreeable experiences
usually met with there; but our hopes were rudely dispelled when,
after two days, having fairly got into the bay, we found a strong
&ldquo;nor&rsquo;-wester&rdquo; blowing, with heavy seas and
torrents of rain.</p>
<p>Our ship was a duplicate of the ill-fated
&ldquo;London,&rdquo; and the officers comforted us with the
information that we were just on the spot where she had gone down
a few years before.</p>
<p>The wind and waves had been increasing in force during the
day; but at four o&rsquo;clock, just as we were sitting down to
dinner, a heavy sea burst &rsquo;tween decks with a great uproar,
breaking through the doors leading from the main-deck to the
saloon, swamping the nearest cabins, and completely scattering
the dinner, dishes and all.</p>
<p>The stewards had a busy time of it for the next two hours in
mopping and baling the water out, and in preparing another
dinner.&nbsp; Many of us, however, preferred retiring to our
berths, the weather in the meantime getting decidedly
worse.&nbsp; Presently another sea was shipped, deluging our
cabin, amongst others, and leaving us in perfect darkness; while
the noise of the sailors tramping overhead, the smashing of
crockery, and the falling of blocks and ropes, the shouts of the
officers, and the continual roar of the storm, effectually
banished sleep for the night.&nbsp; I gained, however, one
valuable piece of information, for as a result of the storm I
learned a certain cure for sea-sickness!&nbsp; I had been quite
ill before the final burst, but the excitement from this cured me
instantly.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>During
the night we travelled out of the storm into smoother water, and
it was curious to note the effect of this improved state of
affairs, and of the bright sunshine, in bringing fresh faces on
deck.</p>
<p>The life of a steward on board one of these ships is not an
enviable one.&nbsp; He has to be up at work at four
o&rsquo;clock, washing and scrubbing the saloon; to wait at table
four times a day; to make the beds, and attend to the cabins; and
to be generally useful amongst the passengers, rarely finishing
before ten o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; Our steward was a very
handy fellow.&nbsp; He informed me he had a brother in New
Zealand in practice as a doctor, who wanted him to settle there,
but he preferred &ldquo;a life on the ocean wave.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
strongly recommended us to bathe frequently in salt water, saying
it &ldquo;was good for the spin-ial orgins!&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Eight days after leaving Plymouth we passed the Canary
Islands, steaming between Teneriffe and Gomera.&nbsp; The weather
was delightful, and we had a fine view of <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>the famous
Peak, which rises apparently straight out of the sea to a height
of 12,000 feet.&nbsp; These islands form a province of Spain, and
are volcanic in their origin.&nbsp; The last eruption was in
1824.&nbsp; The vegetable productions of the islands are very
varied.&nbsp; Palms and tropical plants grow near the sea; higher
up cereals are grown; above, laurels; and still higher, pines and
the white broom.&nbsp; The islands also produce oranges, lemons,
dates, sugar-cane, cotton, and silk.</p>

src="images/p8.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Soon after passing the Canaries the Tropics are entered; and
some of us begin to feel, for the first time, what heat really
is.&nbsp; Awnings are fixed, and preparations are made for
various kinds of amusements, amongst which the most popular are
quoits, a run with the hounds, jumping in sacks by moonlight,
racing in sacks, etc.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>The game
of quoits is much in favour with those who can play it, but it is
a most selfish affair, for half-a-dozen men monopolise the whole
of one side of the deck&mdash;and that the best or upper
side&mdash;and, beginning at ten in the morning, continue till
the dinner hour.</p>
<p>These are the day amusements.&nbsp; In the evenings there are
concerts, recitations, and occasionally theatrical
performances.&nbsp; Some passengers are of a studious turn, and
divide their time between reading, writing, and walking, while
others&mdash;notably young men from the Colonies&mdash;recline at
ease during the day and become lively at night, often
perambulating the decks with heavy heels till the small hours of
the morning, to the great discomfort of those sleeping below.</p>
<p>Our second-class fellow-passengers commenced the concert
season by giving a very amusing entertainment in their
saloon.&nbsp; The first piece on the programme was an
&ldquo;overture by the band&rdquo;&mdash;the band being
represented by a single concertina.&nbsp; The chairman, a
jolly-looking old tar, tried three pieces, and broke down in
amidst roars of laughter and calls for the chorus.&nbsp; An
&ldquo;ancient buffer&rdquo; sang &ldquo;My Pretty Jane,&rdquo;
and a few other sentimental things, with looks of fond
affection.&nbsp; Then came a solo by &ldquo;Bones,&rdquo; and
another sailor gave a song which recounted his many
ailments.&nbsp; He said he had had &ldquo;brownchitis,&rdquo;
&ldquo;scarlatina,&rdquo; &ldquo;concertina,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;tightness in the chest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then a melancholy
youth ground out something about his love for a &ldquo;Little
brown jug,&rdquo; calling frequently for a chorus, the whole
ending with &ldquo;God save the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had other concerts during the voyage, and it was noticeable
that the peculiarity which is said to attend <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>amateur
performances on land was not absent with us, for our concerts
were usually productive of anything but harmony&mdash;at any rate
amongst the singers.&nbsp; Those who were first invited to sing
usually had colds, and those who were free from colds often
declined because they were not invited first.&nbsp; Even the
singing of hymns at the evening service was more than once made
the occasion of heated discussion.</p>
<p>Another mode of occupying leisure hours on board ship as soon
as the passengers have fairly settled down for the voyage is to
start a newspaper.&nbsp; A few of the passengers meet and choose
an editor, and the general public are invited to send
contributions to him.&nbsp; At the outset promises of help are
very abundant, but, as a matter of fact, the work has to be done
by a very few persons.&nbsp; The paper appears weekly, in
manuscript, and is usually read aloud by the editor after dinner
on the day of issue.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is agreed to have the paper printed on reaching
the Colony, and when that is determined upon one or two
individuals undertake the duty of passing it through the press,
and of forwarding it to the various subscribers.&nbsp; As a rule
the same persons rarely undertake the duty twice, for it is a
very arduous and oft-times thankless task.</p>
<p>Some of the more cautious subscribers object to paying in
advance, or require guarantees for due delivery and for the
proper performance of the work.&nbsp; On one occasion one of my
companions undertook the work of preparing the paper for the
press, and correcting the proofs; it took him nearly three weeks
to do so, and I am sure he will never undertake a similar
task.&nbsp; The <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>colonial printer gave him a great deal of trouble,
persisting in ignoring his corrections, and in &ldquo;improving
the text&rdquo; by altering it according to his own ideas.&nbsp;
One peculiarity of amateur authorship came out into strong relief
in the printing of this paper&mdash;the number of quotations and
of inverted commas was so great that our printer&rsquo;s stock
was quite exhausted, and he had to send all round the city to
borrow a sufficient supply.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In a three months&rsquo; voyage the advantage of having a
genial captain is obvious, and in this respect we were <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>most
fortunate, for it was impossible for anyone to be kinder or more
considerate.&nbsp; Our captain entered heartily into all our
amusements and schemes for the relief of the monotony of the
voyage, and was ably seconded in his efforts by his amiable
wife.</p>
<p>Sometimes it did appear to some of the more eager and
impatient of the passengers that the captain was fonder of being
on the water than they were; for he had a great regard for his
sails, and whenever the wind developed unusual energy had no
hesitation in diminishing the rate of our progress by shortening
sail.&nbsp; The first officer, perhaps with the rashness of
youth, would crowd all sail during his watch before breakfast,
but when the captain made his appearance an order to &ldquo;Take
in those sails&rdquo; would be promptly addressed to the
chief.</p>
<p>Our captain had made the voyage more than twenty times, and
had very carefully studied and noted the meteorological signs in
various latitudes.&nbsp; The sky seemed like a book to him, and
often when we could see no indications of change&mdash;and it was
wonderful how quickly changes sometimes came&mdash;he would
rapidly make his arrangements, and was rarely caught by the most
sudden of tropical squalls.&nbsp; Our first experience of one of
these squalls was when we were fifty miles to the south of
Madeira.&nbsp; The weather had been fine all day, but about five
o&rsquo;clock we were aroused by great activity on the part of
the officers and crew, who acted as though they expected to be
boarded by pirates.&nbsp; The sky had become cloudy, and we were
told that a squall was expected.&nbsp; The captain stood at the
stern and gave his orders to the first officer in a <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>quiet manner,
while the latter shouted them to the sailors, who at once began
to climb and pull at the ropes, all the while singing their sea
songs.&nbsp; In the meantime the wind had come up, and was
blowing like a hurricane through the rigging, and then the rain
came down in torrents.&nbsp; While this was going on we saw a
ship at a little distance, also overtaken by the squall, and it
was wonderful to see how soon they took in her sails&mdash;it was
done in a twinkling.&nbsp; Our vessel rolled and pitched heavily,
and everything looked wet and wretched; but the squall passed off
almost as quickly as it came, and the sun shone out, and
everything looked smiling again.&nbsp; Unfortunately, during the
storm the wind changed right ahead.</p>
<p>Our captain was a Tory, as most long-voyage captains
are.&nbsp; I have often thought it strange that it should be so,
seeing that the whole purpose of a captain&rsquo;s life is to
make progress on his voyage; but it would appear that, although
he is always progressing, he invariably comes back to his
starting point.</p>
<p>At dinner one day, happening to say I was from Birmingham, the
captain said jocularly, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s where all the
shams come from!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now the captain hails from London, but his wife is an Irish
lady, so I answered, &ldquo;No, captain, the things known as
Brummagem shams are like the Irish bulls, and are, for the most
part, manufactured in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said the captain&rsquo;s wife;
&ldquo;well done, Mr. Tangye,&rdquo; and the captain
subsided.</p>
<p>Truly life on shipboard is a curious medley.&nbsp; Here is a
picture of what went on one night.&nbsp; In the lower tier of
cabins lies a young man in the last stage of <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>consumption,
and almost in the agonies of death; in a cabin just above him is
another suffering from scarlet fever; within a few feet of these
are mothers nursing their babies.&nbsp; Sitting in a corner of
the saloon is another young man, also in the final stage of
consumption, away from all his friends, and without a single
acquaintance on board; in front of him are two card parties, one
of them playing for money, and looking as eager about it as
though dear life depended on success.</p>
<p>While all this is going on below, what might have been a
tragedy is being enacted on deck, for the quartermaster went
suddenly mad while standing at the wheel.&nbsp; The captain had
just given him some instructions, but he did not seem to take
kindly to them, and was inclined to be disputatious.&nbsp;
Presently he said, with an oath, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t argue with
you to-night, captain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The captain then ordered
another man to take the wheel, when the poor fellow ran along the
deck and fell forward, kicking vigorously.&nbsp; The captain,
thinking the man was in a fit, summoned the doctor, who, after
waiting till the patient became quieter, tried to persuade him to
go forward with him.&nbsp; The man, however, suddenly sprang up
and aimed a tremendous blow at the poor little doctor, who,
fortunately, being cunning of fence, managed to evade it.&nbsp;
He then chased the doctor around the deck, and would doubtless
have thrown him overboard if he could have caught him.&nbsp; The
first officer then came to the rescue and seized the lunatic,
but, although a very strong man, the doctor and he were unable to
hold him, and ultimately it took six men to carry him
forward.&nbsp; At last they managed to secure him, as they
thought, but in a very short time <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the sailors came rushing pell-mell on
to the poop-deck, the maniac having got loose and begun to chase
them with a long fork.&nbsp; It was some time before they could
again secure him, but finally they succeeded, and put him into a
strait-jacket.</p>
<p>In the morning the first officer went to see the poor fellow,
who asked him to shake hands, but the officer declined.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I saved all your
lives last night, for if I hadn&rsquo;t put the ship about she
would have been right into that other ship on the starboard
bow!&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course this was entirely a delusion, for
there had been no ship there.</p>
<p>Soon after entering the Tropics on one of my voyages, one of
the second-class passengers was taken ill, and died in a few
hours; he had been suffering from an attack of <i>delirium
tremens</i>.&nbsp; The funeral was arranged to take place at 7.30
on the following morning, and at the appointed time the body,
which had been sewn up in sail-cloth, was placed on trestles on
the main deck, opposite a port-hole, the &ldquo;Union Jack&rdquo;
covering it.&nbsp; Presently the bell began to toll, while the
clergyman and captain read the service for the dead, and when the
latter came to the passage &ldquo;We therefore commit his body to
the deep,&rdquo; he looked at the sailors, who at once loosed the
corpse, which, being weighted with iron, shot through the open
port-hole into the water with a great splash.&nbsp; During the
ceremony the engines were stopped.</p>
<p>The day following was Sunday, and it being a glorious day,
with a perfectly smooth sea, it was arranged for the service to
be held on deck, which was covered with an awning.&nbsp; One of
the passengers had <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>brought a set of hand-bells with him, and he and some
others rang out a peal before the service, the effect being
curious.</p>
<p>The water was of a beautiful purple colour, and the sky a deep
blue, and some large white birds were lazily flying around the
ship.&nbsp; Under these unusual circumstances, and with the
solemn incident of the burial of the poor drunkard on the
previous day, one would have thought that even the dullest
minister would have felt a thrill of inspiration.&nbsp; Judge,
then, of our surprise when the parson commenced talking to us
about geology!&nbsp; Nor did he make the slightest reference to
the scene around him during the whole sermon.&nbsp; He told us,
incidentally, that miners had not yet succeeded in getting more
than twelve miles deep!&nbsp; During the afternoon I ventured to
ask him where the mine was situated of which he had spoken, as,
happening to know something about mining operations, I was
anxious to know how the miners managed to pump the water from a
depth of twelve miles.&nbsp; He answered testily, &ldquo;I was
not speaking of any particular mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On one occasion a discussion arose as to the best means to be
adopted to ensure the attendance of the working classes at
church.&nbsp; The reverend gentleman told us that for his part he
had no difficulty in getting people to attend his
church&mdash;all classes and conditions of people came to hear
him, and yet he took no special means to secure their
attendance.&nbsp; Not being impressed with the parson&rsquo;s
eloquence, we were at a loss to understand how it was that he was
so successful, when far abler and more attractive men failed so
conspicuously; but he vouchsafed no explanation.&nbsp; On
arriving in the <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Colony the explanation was forthcoming, for I found that
our reverend friend was chaplain to a cemetery!</p>
<p>On another occasion the old gentleman preached a sermon in
which he related an anecdote of a soldier who was mortally
wounded on the field of Waterloo.&nbsp; One of the chaplains
found the poor fellow, who showed him a Bible which he had always
carried in his pocket, it having been given him by his mother on
leaving home.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said the clergyman,
&ldquo;this young man, having served his country to the death,
went straight to glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Curiously enough, in the
lesson for that day occurred the verse, &ldquo;Love your
enemies,&rdquo; etc., so during the day I asked him how he
reconciled the verse with the idea of the red-handed soldier
going straight to glory?&nbsp; The parson (who was an Irishman)
replied, &ldquo;Sure, the soldier was heaping <i>fire</i> on his
enemy&rsquo;s head!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In about eighteen days after leaving Plymouth we reached the
island of Ascension, whose fine group of volcanic peaks formed a
magnificent object from our steamer.&nbsp; The island is used as
a sanatorium for <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>the British Colonies on the west coast of Africa.&nbsp;
It has an area of about thirty-five square miles, and produces an
abundance of turtles, pheasants, peafowl, and eggs, while
tomatoes, castor-oil plants, and pepper, are indigenous.</p>
<p>The first officer went ashore with a boat to take our letters,
and to bring back some turtles for use during the voyage.&nbsp;
Immediately the boat left the ship we saw a big shark following
close in its wake, the brute&rsquo;s fin showing above the water
until the landing-stage was reached.&nbsp; This gave us some
concern, as sharks are very bold at times, and have been known to
snap at a hand hanging over the side of a boat.&nbsp; We saw
large numbers about the ship during our stay, and one of the
passengers shot several of them with a rifle.&nbsp; One was quite
near to the ship when shot, and on feeling the bullet leaped
right out of the water, and was instantly attacked and doubtless
devoured by its brethren on falling back into the sea.&nbsp; We
also put out a hook baited with pork, and observed several of the
sharks make attempts upon it; but they appeared to be very
clumsy, for they repeatedly missed it.&nbsp; Presently, however,
one fellow got the hook firmly into his mouth, and we hauled him
in over the stern on to the poop.&nbsp; He dashed about madly,
looked very vicious, and reared right up on end, when the sailors
barbarously hacked his tail off.&nbsp; Soon he was hauled on to
the main-deck and quickly despatched, his teeth being on sale at
a shilling each in less than an hour afterwards.&nbsp; Three
turtles were brought on board &ldquo;all alive,&rdquo; and placed
on their backs on the deck until they were required by the
cook.&nbsp; They each measured 5ft.6in. long by 3ft. wide, and
6ft.8in. in girth, and each weighed about 330 lbs.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>One day
we had very rough weather, with an occasional sea dashing over
the deck, along which the dinner was brought from the
kitchen.&nbsp; My steward quietly told me to take none of the
turtle soup, and I obeyed.&nbsp; After dinner I asked him why he
advised me to let the soup pass?&nbsp; He said that as they were
coming along the deck a sea came over and washed half the soup
out of the tureen, decidedly mixing what was left!&nbsp; Those
who partook of the soup remarked that the cook had put rather too
much salt to it; but they libelled that useful functionary.</p>

<p>One of our fellow-passengers was an old German lady, who was
returning from a visit to her fatherland.&nbsp; She was very
lively, and informed us she had not told her husband she was
returning by this ship, intending, as she said, &ldquo;to catch
him on de hop,&rdquo; but she did not know that the
passengers&rsquo; names were all sent on by the mail, which <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>went faster
than we did; so when we got to the port her husband,
&ldquo;Shemmy&rdquo; (Jemmy), as she called him, had come out
with the pilot, and was very near catching her on &ldquo;de
hop,&rdquo; for she was a very lively old lady.&nbsp; One
morning, while we were in the Tropics, upon getting on deck, we
found the old lady dressed from head to foot in scarlet!&nbsp; It
was too much, with the thermometer at 101&deg; in the shade, so a
deputation waited upon her and begged her to shade her glory, for
it was too overpowering.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>After being a month at sea the sailors performed the ceremony
called &ldquo;Burying the Dead Horse,&rdquo; the explanation of
which is this: Before leaving port seamen are paid a month in
advance, so as to enable them to leave some money with their
wives, or to buy a new kit, etc., and having spent the money they
consider the first month goes for nothing, and so call it
&ldquo;Working off the Dead Horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; The crew dress up
a figure to represent a horse; its body is made out of a barrel,
its extremities of hay or straw covered with canvas, the mane and
tail of hemp, the eyes of two ginger beer bottles, sometimes
filled with phosphorus.&nbsp; When complete the noble steed is
put on a box, covered with a rug, and on the evening of the last
day of the month a <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>man gets on to his back, and is drawn all round the ship
by his shipmates, to the chanting of the following
doggerel:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p22.jpg">
<img alt=
"Music to Burying the Dead Horse"
title=
"Music to Burying the Dead Horse"
src="images/p22.jpg" />
</a></p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">BURYING THE DEAD
HORSE.</p>
<p>You have come a long long way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we say so, for we know so.<br />
For to be sold upon this day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor old man.</p>
<p>You are goin&rsquo; now to say good-bye,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we say so, for we know so.<br />
Poor old horse you&rsquo;re a goin&rsquo; to die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Old Man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having paraded the decks in order to get an audience, the sale
of the horse by auction is announced, and a glib-mouthed man
mounts the rostrum and begins to praise the noble animal, giving
his pedigree, etc., saying it was a good one to go, for it had
gone 6,000 <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>miles in the past month!&nbsp; The bidding then
commences, each bidder being responsible only for the amount of
his advance on the last bid.&nbsp; After the sale the horse and
its rider are run up to the yard-arm amidst loud cheers.&nbsp;
Fireworks are let off, the man gets off the horse&rsquo;s back,
and, cutting the rope, lets it fall into the water.&nbsp; The
<i>Requiem</i> is then sung to the same melody.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now he is dead and will die no more,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we say so, for we know so.<br />
Now he is gone and will go no more;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Old Man.</p>

</a></p>
<p>After this the auctioneer and his clerk proceed to collect the
&ldquo;bids,&rdquo; and if in your ignorance of auction etiquette
you should offer your&rsquo;s to the auctioneer, he politely
declines it, and refers you to his clerk!</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>As we
neared the Equator the heat became very oppressive.&nbsp; On
October 2nd, when 7&deg; north of the line, the thermometer stood
at 120&deg; in the sun, while under the awning it registered
85&deg;.&nbsp; On the thermometer being dipped into the sea the
temperature of the surface water was found to be 82&deg;, while
in the cabin at midnight the thermometer stood at 80&deg;, with
the wind blowing in at the open porthole.</p>
<p>In passing under the vertical sun the old proverb &ldquo;may
your shadow never grow less&rdquo; is entirely out of place, for
it is impossible it can diminish, unless, indeed, one should
become like poor misguided Peter Schlemihl, and find oneself
altogether without one!&nbsp; When standing upright my shadow was
about two feet in diameter, and it looked like the shadow of the
brim of my hat all round my feet.</p>
<p>The wife of the captain of our steamer had been very unwell
until we had passed the Equator, and had not come out of her
cabin.&nbsp; One evening, soon after she made her first
appearance, I was chatting with her, when, finding I was from
Cornwall, she asked me if I knew a certain watering-place in that
county which she named.&nbsp; It happened that I had a residence
at the place in question, and curiously enough she had been a
visitor at the same house before I had it, and she said,
&ldquo;last year my sister was staying in the neighbourhood with
some friends, when they were nearly caught by the tide on the
beach opposite the house, and had to scale the face of the cliff,
climbing up some old ladders left in an abandoned
mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; I told her if they had taken my advice, and
had turned back, they would not have had such an unpleasant
adventure, for I happened to be <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>on the beach at the time, and warned
the party of their danger, but they disregarded it!&nbsp; It was
curious to be reminded of this occurrence under such
circumstances.</p>
<p>Amongst our fellow-passengers were two young men, whose
friends, it was reported, had become tired of them at home, and
had made a present of them to the Colonies.&nbsp; They were very
lively youths, and did their best to keep the ship lively by
their pranks and escapades.&nbsp; They were known by the names of
&ldquo;Tall and Fat,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Short and Stout,&rdquo;
and were always together.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, the
playfulness of these two young men received an unexpected
check.&nbsp; On one occasion they had gone &ldquo;forward&rdquo;
to play some tricks upon the emigrants, who, however, did not see
the fun; so, having got the lads into a corner, they covered
them, first with molasses and then with flour, and so returned
them to the saloon.&nbsp; They did not repeat their visit.</p>
<p>There is one feature on board many ships which always strikes
passengers with surprise; and that is the impunity with which the
&ldquo;wild spirits&rdquo; carry on their disorderly
conduct.&nbsp; Drinking, betting, shouting, tramping the deck at
unseemly hours of the night, are permitted, to the great
annoyance of the majority; but it is in vain that you appeal to
the officers&mdash;they will not interfere.&nbsp; On one occasion
a noisy youth, who went by the name of the &ldquo;Blatant
Beast,&rdquo; was firing a revolver about &ldquo;at large,&rdquo;
and although we appealed to the captain, and begged that he would
disarm the lad, it was useless&mdash;he would not
interfere.&nbsp; Ultimately the young man accidentally discharged
the pistol and broke his arm, and so relieved his neighbours from
further apprehensions for a time.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>One
night &ldquo;Short and Stout&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tall and
Fat,&rdquo; and a few other rowdies, got drunk, and in their
rambles found a poor harmless cat, which they chased all over the
ship, and succeeded in killing.&nbsp; On the following day these
gallant youths determined, in Irish phrase, to &ldquo;wake&rdquo;
the cat.&nbsp; They proceeded to fit up one of their cabins as a
chapel, and upon a bier the corpse of poor pussy was laid, having
been dressed for the occasion, candles surrounding the
body.&nbsp; The mourners, or murderers, stood around the body
with pipes in their mouths, meggy-howling and cat-a-wauling in a
most vigorous fashion, afterwards parading the deck, headed by
one of their party, arrayed in a dress coat over a night shirt,
and wearing a tall white hat, carrying the dead body of poor puss
before him.</p>
<p>Betting is often carried on to a great extent, considerable
sums of money changing hands.&nbsp; One passenger told me, after
we had been some weeks at sea, that he had cleared enough to pay
for his own passage, and also for that of his wife and child, and
that it only remained for him to win enough to pay for the nurse,
and to take them all from Australia to New Zealand, and he should
be happy!&nbsp; I knew one man, the father of a very large
family, who lost &pound;700 in three weeks, &pound;400 of it
going at a single night&rsquo;s play; yet, with striking
consistency, this open-handed gentleman refused to allow his wife
and daughters to go on shore at one of the most interesting of
our ports of call on the score of the expense, which he said
would amount to at least &pound;2 or &pound;3!</p>
<p>A pleasant sight it is to watch the fish and birds which begin
to make their appearance about 30&deg; S.&nbsp; Occasionally <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>flocks of
flying-fish are to be seen flying a few feet above the water,
pursued by dolphins.&nbsp; Sometimes their headlong flight
carries them right on to the deck, or through the cabin windows
when lighted up after nightfall.&nbsp; They are caught by the
sailors at night by the simple device of suspending a net in
front of a lantern, and they are said to be very good when
cooked.</p>
<p>We first saw that splendid bird, the albatross, when about
28&deg; S. latitude, and when more than 1,000 miles from
land.&nbsp; They appeared in flocks, and would follow the ship
for many days.&nbsp; Their flight is exceedingly graceful, and
very rapid, the movement of their wings being scarcely
perceptible.&nbsp; The capture of the albatross is a favourite
amusement upon sailing ships&mdash;it is scarcely possible to
catch them from a steamer&mdash;the plan being to let out a line
over the stern, having a strong hook baited with a piece of meat
or with red cloth.&nbsp; We were successful in catching a
magnificent fellow, which measured 15ft. across its wings.&nbsp;
A drop of prussic acid applied to the eye of the poor creature
causes instant death.&nbsp; The breast forms an excellent muff,
and the wing bones make good stems for pipes of the
&ldquo;churchwarden&rdquo; pattern.&nbsp; One of our passengers
was a fiery Irishman, who was travelling with his newly-married
wife.&nbsp; One day, while at dinner, the ship gave a heavy
lurch, and the lady fell back, breaking her chair; upon which her
husband, in a great rage, seized the chair, and, rushing on deck,
threw it overboard, when lo! a flock of albatrosses crowded
around it, and one fine fellow &ldquo;took&rdquo; the chair, and
appeared to be addressing his friends!</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>One of
the most beautiful creatures to be seen in tropical waters is the
&ldquo;Portuguese Man-of-War.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is often confounded
with the Nautilus, but is a quite distinct organism; it has a
crest which can be raised or lowered at will, and its body
consists of a long, horizontal, oblong bladder filled with
air.&nbsp; They vary in size from 12in. diameter to small discs
no larger than a shilling, and present a beautiful appearance as
the ship passes by a fleet of them.</p>

</a></p>
<p>We caught some dolphins, and an examination of their stomachs
proved they were not unjustly suspected of eating the pretty
little flying-fish.&nbsp; The pilot-fish, also found in these
latitudes, is coloured purple and <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>silver, with five black bands across
it, and is about five inches in length.&nbsp; We also saw
specimens of the white shark, porpoises, grampuses, Mother
Carey&rsquo;s chickens, booby-birds, etc.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting sights at sea is the passing of
ships.&nbsp; I shall never forget our meeting a ship in full sail
one glorious moonlight night.&nbsp; It came close to us, the moon
shining full on its sails, and being like our vessel, a sailing
ship, not a sound was heard until our captain hailed the
stranger, and asked him to report us &ldquo;all well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One would think there was not much danger of collision at sea,
in broad daylight and in the open ocean, but on one occasion,
while in a sailing ship, another came so close to us that it was
only by the most dexterous management on the part of our captain
that a collision was avoided.</p>
<p>The monotony of a long voyage is occasionally relieved by the
opportunity of sending letters in homeward-bound ships, and when
we had been out about a month we were told to have our letters
ready, for a ship was in sight.&nbsp; Everyone was immediately
deeply engaged in writing, and presently the stranger came
sufficiently near for us to communicate with her.&nbsp; Our
signal was run up, &ldquo;Will you take letters for us?&rdquo; to
which she quickly replied, &ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; and then
a boat left us to take our letter-bag on board the
&ldquo;homeward-bound.&rdquo;&nbsp; This vessel was from Moulmein
with teak, and she had been one hundred days out.&nbsp; Those on
board had heard nothing of the Cabul massacre, but they brought
us news of the capture of Cetewayo, having got it from a passing
ship.&nbsp; In return <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>for this intelligence we told them of
the death of the Prince Imperial, which they had not heard of,
although it happened before the capture of Cetewayo.</p>
<p>Some of our passengers went on board the passing ship, and two
of them scrambled up the rigging, and presently we saw a sailor
follow them and tie their legs to the rigging, releasing them as
soon as they had paid their footing.&nbsp; In the evening the two
ships parted company, saluting each other with rockets of various
colours.</p>
<p>While our letters were being taken on board the homeward-bound
ship, we saw a huge shark follow the boat until it reached the
vessel, and on hearing a shout, &ldquo;a big fish!&rdquo; we ran
to the ship&rsquo;s side and saw a whale not more than a hundred
feet off.&nbsp; The monster gave a loud snort, spouted water, and
then made off.&nbsp; I wonder if it had any idea what we
were?</p>
<p>There was a boxing match going forward one day, when the
captain invited the parson to put the gloves on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
no,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am a man of peace
<i>now</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He told me he objected to war as much as
anyone could do.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;your
Church does not.&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied that there was nothing
in the teaching of the Church which advocated war; so I asked
him, if that was the case, what that part of the prayer-book
meant where a hope is expressed that the Queen may
&ldquo;vanquish and overcome all her enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At dinner one day our friend undertook to explain to us how
drain-pipes were made.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;You know those round
things that are put in the earth to carry off the
water?&rdquo;&nbsp; Some one suggested drain-pipes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know they take a kind
of clay not <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>like other clay, and put it into a sort of machine and
turn it around and the pipes are made.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought his
description was not so good as that of the Irishman who explained
the manufacture of cast-iron pipes by saying, &ldquo;You take a
round hole and pour the metal around it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some one remarking that we were now 36&deg; south, he said,
&ldquo;Ah, that is just 4&deg; below freezing,&rdquo; having
confused the degrees of latitude with those of the
thermometer.&nbsp; Upon being told that 32&deg; was the freezing
point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I always
thought it was 40&deg;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In listening to most of the clergymen with whom I have
travelled, I have been irresistibly reminded of the complaint
made so bitterly, and with so much truth, by Australian importers
in the early gold-finding days, that English merchants and
manufacturers were utterly reckless as to the quality of the
goods they sent out, <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>acting on the principle that
&ldquo;anything will do for the Colonies.&rdquo;&nbsp; This idea
has long ceased to have any currency, for it has been discovered
that the coinage of the Australian mint ranks equally with that
of London, but it does not appear that those responsible for the
due supply of clergymen to the Colonies have realised the same
truth, for on every hand I have had my own experience
confirmed.&nbsp; The general complaint amongst the colonists,
especially in the country districts, is that either young and
totally inexperienced men are sent to them, or else men who have
proved failures at home; and they not unnaturally resent such
treatment.</p>
<p>In a recent voyage we had a large number of steerage
passengers, and amongst them was a very earnest, hard-working
evangelist from Mr. Spurgeon&rsquo;s college; this man had
sacrificed his ease during the voyage by attending to the sick
and ailing &ldquo;in season and out of season,&rdquo; and was
admitted on all sides to have done much good; frequently, too, he
held religious services amongst the steerage passengers, and met
with great acceptance.&nbsp; One man had been very ill for a long
time, and had been tenderly waited upon by the evangelist.&nbsp;
After a time he became suddenly worse, and some passengers at
once went to a clergyman, who suggested that the Communion should
be administered.&nbsp; Having obtained the help of another
clergyman and two or three of the passengers&mdash;none of whom
had before shown any interest in the patient&mdash;they proceeded
on their errand without saying a word to the evangelist, and on
the following Sunday the clergyman preached a sermon to the poor
people, endeavouring to prove that no one had any right to <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>teach or to
preach but members of his Church, who, only, held the true
commission, by virtue of what he called the &ldquo;direct
succession from Peter:&rdquo; and I suppose he thought he was
preaching religion, not perceiving that he lacked what Paul
described as being the highest of all the Christian
virtues&mdash;that of charity.</p>
<p>In passing through the Tropics one of the most glorious sights
is the phosphorescence in the sea.&nbsp; Of course it can be seen
to the greatest advantage in the absence of the moon; it is
something wonderful, and worth coming all the way to see.&nbsp;
As far as the eye can reach, the track of the vessel is marked
out with the utmost brilliancy, and sometimes tiny balls of
phosphorus seem to explode, scattering their radiance far and
wide.</p>
<p>We had as fellow-passengers three young men who rarely spoke
to anyone outside their own party, and during the early part of
the voyage they usually sat on the deck for hours at a time
engaged in reading their Bibles and making notes on the
margin.&nbsp; After we had been out a few weeks the youngest of
the three was stricken with scarlet fever, and at one time he was
seriously ill.</p>
<p>The trio were known as the &ldquo;Danite Band.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The eldest was a young man about twenty-one, and one evening I
had a little chat with him.&nbsp; He said he belonged to no sect;
he had &ldquo;come out from among them&rdquo;&mdash;that his soul
was safe, die when he would, and that he could only look on the
poor sinners around him with a pitying eye, and pray for their
souls.&nbsp; He was rejoicing at having saved one soul since he
came on board.&nbsp; It so happened that this young man occupied
the <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>same
cabin as the youth who was ill with fever, but becoming alarmed
for his personal safety (not his soul&rsquo;s), he requested to
be accommodated elsewhere, while another passenger volunteered to
take his place and to nurse the invalid, so they exchanged
cabins.&nbsp; On the following Sunday the young man who had
volunteered as nurse knocked at the pious young man&rsquo;s door
and asked for his boots, receiving for answer, &ldquo;I
won&rsquo;t be bothered about boots on the Lord&rsquo;s
Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is usual to hold a bazaar on passenger ships proceeding to
or from the Colonies.&nbsp; These bazaars are almost invariably
held in aid of the funds of the Merchant Seaman&rsquo;s Hospital
and other similar institutions, and a large sum is annually
obtained in this way.&nbsp; The result in the case of the sailing
vessel in which I made one of my voyages was a sum of over
&pound;50, besides some annual subscriptions, although the number
of adult saloon passengers was only about thirty.</p>
<p>Great preparations were made for this bazaar, it being the
event of the voyage.&nbsp; The day previous the sailors were
busily engaged closing-in the promenade deck with canvas and
bunting, and dividing it off into stalls by means of flags and
other coloured materials.&nbsp; While thus engaged, another
sailing vessel came in sight, and the sea being nearly dead calm
the two vessels approached closely, and parties were speedily
passing to and fro.&nbsp; We invited some of the passengers in
the stranger to join us to-morrow, and they invested about
&pound;5 in lotteries before going back for the night.</p>
<p>Next day was a most lovely one, but a heavy rolling sea was
sufficient to prevent our visitors of yesterday joining us.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed the <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>day
ourselves, for the whole ship&rsquo;s company&mdash;passengers,
crew, men, women, and children&mdash;held high carnival on the
promenade deck.&nbsp; It was pretty to see the children of the
second class who, owing to the high bulwarks, were rarely able to
see over the ship&rsquo;s side, rush first of all to look over
the rail at the heaving sea.</p>
<p>The first officer was dressed as a showman, and presided over
the Fine Art Exhibition, his face being painted a fine
terra-cotta tint.&nbsp; The crew and stewards were variously
costumed as nigger minstrels, etc.&nbsp; The stalls were presided
over by the ladies, who, as usual, were very successful in
disposing of the various articles, which, by the way, were for
the most part made up by the ladies themselves during the
voyage.&nbsp; Much curiosity was excited by the announcement of a
dramatic performance, entitled &ldquo;The White Squall,&rdquo;
which was to take place in the Theatre Royal.&nbsp; The <i>corps
dramatique</i> evinced great anxiety to secure the attendance of
the whole ship&rsquo;s company, and were fairly successful.&nbsp;
The performance did not take long, for as soon as the audience
were seated cries of &ldquo;Let go&rdquo; were heard from the
actors, upon which the air was filled with a veritable
&ldquo;White Squall,&rdquo; consisting of clouds of flour,
causing a general stampede.</p>
<p>Next day we found our companion of yesterday lying at some
distance ahead, while a stranger lay on the port quarter.&nbsp; A
curious instance of cross-signalling ensued.&nbsp; The stranger
asks our companion, the St. Vincent, for latitude and
longitude.&nbsp; The St. Vincent missing this, and intent on
their investment in yesterday&rsquo;s lottery, puts up,
&ldquo;What have we won?&rdquo;&nbsp; The reply,
&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stranger runs up,
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>understand.&nbsp; Repeat, please.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then St.
Vincent replies, &ldquo;Very sorry,&rdquo; upon which our Captain
signals the stranger, and removes all further doubt.</p>
<p>We passed close to the Island of Tristan d&rsquo;Acunha, which
lies in the South Atlantic, lat. 37&deg; 6&prime; S., long.
12&deg; 7&prime; W.&nbsp; As a curious little history attaches to
the island, I make the following extract from our ship&rsquo;s
newspaper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tristan d&rsquo;Acunha is a volcanic peak of very
considerable altitude, so considerable indeed that its summit is
covered almost perpetually with snow.&nbsp; It rises sheer out of
the water, and there is only a single landing-place on the whole
island.&nbsp; Previous to the downfall of Bonaparte it was
uninhabited; but when that scourge was despatched to St. Helena,
the British Government deemed it advisable to secure this
isolated rock, and so prevent the French using it as a base of
operations against the place of Napoleon&rsquo;s
internment.&nbsp; A small company of soldiers, in charge of a
corporal, was therefore despatched, and left in possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1821 Napoleon died, and the necessity for
maintaining the garrison at Tristan existed no longer.&nbsp; A
man-of-war was accordingly sent to bring away the corporal and
his little army.&nbsp; But he and they had by this time
comfortably settled down, tilled the&mdash;rock we were about to
say&mdash;and produced excellent potatoes and other vegetables;
raised pigs and goats, and having in some mysterious way obtained
wives, had raised families too.&nbsp; They were therefore
extremely reluctant to leave the scene of their successful
labours; and the English Government, nothing loth to encourage
colonisation, at once gave the necessary permission to remain,
and with it a small pension or annuity.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;They have gone on flourishing and increasing,
forming a useful and peaceable community in the very centre of
the South Atlantic; useful because whalers and other vessels, by
putting in there, are able to obtain fresh potatoes, vegetables,
and pigs.&nbsp; Little money is used, barter affording sufficient
facility for interchange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crime is almost unknown.&nbsp; We had as well said
absolutely unknown, for it is doubtful whether the one case of
dishonesty on record as such was not rather an ill-fared
joke.&nbsp; It seems that when a marriage takes place a pig is
killed by the bride&rsquo;s father, and dressed the night before
the nuptials.&nbsp; On the occasion referred to the pig
disappeared before morning, and was traced to the house of a
notorious wag, as to whose fate history is silent.&nbsp; It is
only fair to add that he admitted taking the pig, but protested
that it had been done by way of a practical joke.&nbsp; At one
time a missionary existed in the midst of this innocent
community, but he eventually disappeared&mdash;either died or was
removed.&nbsp; His place was never refilled, and the consequences
have been rather trying to the budding men and women of Tristan,
for whereas in the missionary&rsquo;s days loving couples could
be, to use a nautical phrase, &ldquo;spliced,&rdquo; when they
had made up their minds, now they must wait until a chance
man-o&rsquo;-war, with a chaplain on board, puts in, and as their
visits are nearly as rare as those of the angels, the patience of
these Tristan lovers must unquestionably be sorely
strained.&nbsp; When, however, like some comet of very eccentric
orbit, the parson does at length turn up, he finds plenty of ripe
pairs ready&mdash;nay, eager&mdash;for him.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>&ldquo;What a popular man that parson must be!&nbsp;
Last and most interesting fact.&nbsp; When the
&lsquo;Sobraon&rsquo; put in at Tristan in 1879 the corporal was
still living, a venerable patriarch of ninety years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After leaving Tristan we soon get &ldquo;into the
forties,&rdquo; or as the sailors are wont to say, &ldquo;the
rolling forties,&rdquo; where the westerly winds steadily
prevail, and continue right on until we make Cape Leeuwin.&nbsp;
These winds cause the magnificent waves, or
&ldquo;rollers,&rdquo; which tower up over the stern of the
vessel, threatening, apparently, to overwhelm it.&nbsp; In a gale
of wind, and when the &ldquo;following seas&rdquo; are running at
a high speed, it becomes necessary for some vessels to &ldquo;lie
to&rdquo; in order to avoid this catastrophe.&nbsp; We had an
opportunity of seeing this operation.&nbsp; Soon after passing
the Cape we were overtaken by a heavy gale, and a high following
sea.&nbsp; Our vessel being a sailing ship of the old type, with
broad bluff bows, necessitated our adopting that course.&nbsp;
Our stern was turned in the teeth of the wind and sea, and, with
the exception of a top-sail and jib-sail, all our canvas was
closely taken in.&nbsp; She lay so all night labouring heavily,
and the sea breaking over her decks.</p>
<p>Soon after sighting Cape Otway vessels bound for Melbourne
receive their pilot, whose advent is the occasion of great
excitement among the betting fraternity.&nbsp; Bets are laid on
the colour of his hair and whiskers, whether or not he has a
moustache, the letter with which his name begins, and which foot
he will first put on deck.&nbsp; As soon as he makes his
appearance he is greeted with shouts of &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
name?&rdquo;&nbsp; Evidently he is accustomed to it, for he does
not look surprised.&nbsp; In this particular case everyone was
out as <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>to
the colour of his hair and beard, for he had a black beard and
white whiskers.&nbsp; The pilot brought news of a general
election in one of the colonies, and one of our passengers, a
colonial statesman, eagerly asked him for papers.&nbsp; The
statesman&rsquo;s countenance was expressive of blankness within
when he saw he was beaten in his constituency&mdash;but soon
brightened on hearing he was returned by another.</p>
<p>The entrance to Hobson&rsquo;s Bay is very narrow, and the
distance therefrom to Melbourne is about 40 miles.&nbsp; We
landed soon after six on a January morning, and found the heat
almost unbearable.&nbsp; Taking a cab to our hotel, we made our
first experience of the high charges in a Protectionist colony,
for we were obliged to pay a guinea for this service.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>When driving to the hotel we were struck with the deserted
appearance of the streets, as very few persons were seen during
our three miles&rsquo; ride from Sandridge.&nbsp; It did not
occur to us that this arose from the earliness of the hour, our
day having commenced about three <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>, when we began to make preparations
for landing; but, as will be seen, the fact became of startling
significance to us.&nbsp; While waiting for breakfast I took up
the newspaper, and had not proceeded far before I came to an
article headed &ldquo;The Black Death in Melbourne.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This article gave a detailed and circumstantial account of the
progress of the disease, which was stated to have been raging for
the past four or five weeks.&nbsp; Among other things, the
article stated that the number of deaths had become so great that
it was impossible to <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>dig separate graves; that the bodies
were placed in trenches, one being dug each day; that all who
could leave the city had fled; and that the mob had surrounded
the Town Hall, demanding to see the Mayor and Corporation, who,
however, had already disappeared.&nbsp; Getting alarmed, we rang
for the waiter, and asked him how we could get to Adelaide.&nbsp;
He naturally enough seemed surprised, as we had only just
arrived.&nbsp; I told him it was too bad he had not warned us of
the state of the city, and of the existence of the plague.&nbsp;
The man looked astonished.&nbsp; I asked him if there had not
been great illness and mortality in the city.&nbsp; He answered
that there had been a few cases of measles, and a whooping-cough
or two, and that six people had died during the last week from
these causes.&nbsp; I began to suspect we had been
&ldquo;sold,&rdquo; and was about to pass the paper to him when I
caught sight of an asterisk placed against the heading, and on
looking at the foot of the column saw that the article was
written as a prediction of what would happen in Melbourne within
100 years unless sanitary matters were at once attended to.</p>
<p>Melbourne is a city of fine broad streets, handsome public
buildings, splendid shops, and vast warehouses.&nbsp; Indeed, a
stranger cannot fail to be struck with its metropolitan-like
character.&nbsp; Only forty years ago the site on which it stands
was a mere swamp with a few log huts; now its population is about
the third of a million souls.&nbsp; For this population a series
of educational institutions of an unusually high character have
been founded, and are in active operation.&nbsp; The Free
Library, which we visited, is a handsome room, and seems in every
way <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>well
adapted to the requirements of a large number of students and
readers.&nbsp; We were impressed with the quietude which
prevailed, notwithstanding that the room was well filled with
readers, most of them apparently of the artisan class.&nbsp; The
Art Gallery is a free institution, and contains a very fair
collection of good paintings.</p>
<p>The Natural History Museum, which by the way is really a
museum of general science, is a truly magnificent
institution.&nbsp; Very fine collections are here classified in a
manner which, while perfectly lucid to the student, is also in
strict accordance with the views of modern scientific
authorities.&nbsp; We noticed particularly a good collection of
sedimentary fossils, well preserved and fairly
comprehensive.&nbsp; A fine meteorolite weighing 30 cwts., a
portion of one weighing four tons which fell in Victoria a few
years ago, is a prominent object near the entrance.&nbsp; This
museum, in common with the Art Gallery and Free Library, is the
resort of vast numbers of students, and it is cheering to be
informed that the working classes largely avail themselves of the
advantages thus provided for them.</p>
<p>As in the other Australian colonies, education here has been
taken up in a vigorous and thorough manner, and the State schools
are a credit to the colony.&nbsp; Although the population of
Victoria is under one million, we observed in Melbourne a school
bearing the inscription No. 1465.&nbsp; But with all this
liberality and foresight, a strange blot exists in the
educational course, for the study of history is, in deference to
the prejudices of a portion of the population, absolutely
interdicted.&nbsp; It is impossible, however, that this absurd
concession to <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>ignorance can long be endured.&nbsp; In leaving Aden on
one occasion I began to have doubts as to whether geography was
also excluded, for a young man, son of a well-to-do squatter,
hearing me speak of Suez, asked which end of the canal that town
stood at; and another youth, in passing the island of Candia,
said he always thought <i>Canada</i> was somewhere in
America.</p>
<p>Happily, no fears exist in Australia as to the policy of
thoroughly educating the people; on the contrary, it is commonly
recognised that the future prosperity of the State&mdash;indeed
its very existence&mdash;depends upon the universal diffusion of
education.</p>
<p>At the time of our visit party feeling ran very high in
connection with the doings of the &ldquo;Berry&rdquo; Ministry,
and as extraordinary personalities were nightly being indulged in
by both sides in the House, we went one evening to hear a
&ldquo;debate.&rdquo;&nbsp; The regular business seemed to be
conducted as well as it is at Westminster, but it was curious to
see the careless way in which the members, in brown holland or
yellow silk coats, lay about on the sofas, or lazily lounged off
to the table for frequent draughts of what was said to be iced
water.&nbsp; The shouts, cries, and interruptions were very
unseemly, much worse than anything we had then experienced,
giving us a very low opinion of the representatives of the
people.&nbsp; One honourable member, in the course of debate,
hurled a heavy tome across the house at the head of one of his
opponents with crushing effect, while another member
characterised the smile of the Minister of Lands as being such as
to &ldquo;sour all the milk in the colony, and to take the
varnish off all the mahogany in the <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>house.&rdquo;&nbsp; This compliment
the Minister lightly parried by remarking that anything coming
from the son of a cabbage hawker could not affect him.</p>
<p>The Melbourne legislators evidently do not believe in having
&ldquo;all work and no play,&rdquo; they have consequently
provided themselves&mdash;of course out of the public
purse&mdash;with billiard tables, and, with a spirit of rare
generosity and thoughtfulness, have made the parliamentary
reporters for the Press free of the rooms.</p>
<p>With such provision for their comfort, and with handsome
salaries paid them for their services by a grateful country, what
wonder that there should be considerable competition for seats
within the walls of the Victorian House of Parliament? and with
what feelings of commiseration must they regard their brethren of
New South Wales, who, when one of their number recently proposed
to imitate the example of Melbourne in the matter of billiard
tables, were reminded, in unmistakable terms by their exacting
constituents, that they were sent to Parliament to work and not
to play!&nbsp; And what makes the matter harder for the Sydney
legislators is the fact that, unlike their Melbourne friends,
they are not paid for their services.</p>
<p>The question of the payment of Members of Parliament has
acquired considerable interest in England of late, mainly in
consequence of Mr. Chamberlain&rsquo;s declaration in its favour;
and it appears not unlikely that at no distant date it may be
carried into effect.&nbsp; There are two modes by which the
object in view may be attained;&mdash;either by a general charge
upon the Imperial Revenue, or by each constituency paying its own
representative; in either case the <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>amount of salary would be determined
by Parliament; and, if the latter course be adopted, its payment
would be made obligatory.&nbsp; In Victoria the salaries are paid
direct from the Treasury, and those who have seen how the system
works are the least enthusiastic in its favour.</p>
<p>Time was, when to be a Member of Parliament was looked upon as
a certain way to repair a broken fortune, or to make a new one;
but since the days when George III., of pious memory, taught his
Ministers how to corrupt the Parliament, a seat in that assembly
has not been considered to be pecuniarily advantageous.&nbsp; But
in some of the Australian colonies the case is different,
politics being looked upon, to a great extent, as a trade or
profession, and very largely because of the salary attached to
the position of Members of the Legislature.</p>
<p>One of my customers in Victoria, who had long owed me
&pound;50, told me he would soon be able to discharge his debt as
he had been nominated for Parliament, and would pay me out of his
first quarter&rsquo;s salary!&nbsp; It is only fair to say that,
although he failed to secure the seat, he nevertheless paid his
debt.</p>
<p>The Houses of Parliament stand on a slight elevation, and
though still unfinished, promise to be a magnificent pile of
buildings, of which many an old-established country, with far
greater pretensions than Victoria, might well be proud.&nbsp; The
Great Hall, a sort of ante-chamber to the Houses, impressed me as
much as any building of the kind I had ever seen.&nbsp; It is
about 180ft. long, by 60ft. wide, and 60ft. high, without
galleries, seats, or anything to detract from its <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>magnificent
proportions.&nbsp; The whole surface of the walls and roof is
covered with a beautiful enamel-like cement, brilliantly white
and polished quite smooth, the floor being of white marble, and a
superb white marble statue of the Queen in the centre.&nbsp; The
whole effect is startlingly beautiful.&nbsp; I subsequently went
over the Town Hall and Council Chamber, but these are much
inferior to corresponding buildings in Birmingham.&nbsp; The
councillors wear cocked hats and gold-braided coats, and the
aldermen black stuff gowns or robes.</p>
<p>I have already spoken of the tension in party politics at the
time of our visit.&nbsp; This was seized upon by the theatrical
people, who produced an adaptation of the burlesque known in
England as &ldquo;Happy Land,&rdquo; the principal characters
being Mr. Berry&mdash;the Premier, the man with the caustic
smile, and another prominent member of the Administration.&nbsp;
On the morning of the day on which the first representation was
to have been given, a Cabinet Council was hastily summoned, and
the question gravely debated as to whether the safety of the
State, or at any rate the Cabinet, would not be compromised by
tolerating the performance.&nbsp; It was quickly and unanimously
decided to prohibit it, and this decision was announced.&nbsp;
Such a universal storm of ridicule was thus aroused that the
infatuated Berryites were driven to reconsider their course,
ultimately licensing an emasculated version of the play, with all
the political references erased.&nbsp; The newspapers, ever alive
to the chance of turning a penny, and showing up an opponent,
published the original <i>in extenso</i>, and when the
performance began large numbers of the audience had copies before
them.&nbsp; <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>When an excised passage was reached, the actor or
actress would pause, and, holding up the hand, whisper audibly,
&ldquo;Hush! prohibited,&rdquo; giving time for those with copies
to read the obnoxious reference.&nbsp; For days after people in
the street would, on meeting, put up the finger, and greet each
other with &ldquo;Hush! prohibited.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Government
were overwhelmed with ridicule, and were glad to compromise with
the persons they had so injudiciously provoked.</p>
<p>During the summer Melbourne is occasionally visited by what
are called &ldquo;hot winds.&rdquo;&nbsp; They blow from the
north, and derive much of their arid character from coming over
the great wastes of the interior.&nbsp; We were unlucky enough to
experience one of these hot winds, and we subsequently learned
that the shade temperature had reached 117&deg;&mdash;as high a
point, I believe, as any that had previously been recorded in the
city.&nbsp; It is no exaggeration to say that while exposed to
the wind it felt like the hot blast from the cupola of a foundry
when iron is being melted.&nbsp; The clothes were little or no
protection against its scorching influence.&nbsp; The air was
filled with choking clouds of dust, which penetrated everything
and everywhere.&nbsp; In the evening, however, the wind fell off,
leaving the temperature very high.</p>
<p>The sanitary arrangements in Melbourne are extremely
defective, and to my mind fully justify the writer of the article
on the &ldquo;Black Death,&rdquo; which so much startled us on
our arrival there.&nbsp; There is literally no system of
sewerage, the whole drainage of the town running by the side of
the pathways in wide ill-paved channels, crossed by wooden foot
bridges.&nbsp; The whole <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>runs into the river Yarra.&nbsp; In
heavy rains these channels become surcharged, and the lower-lying
streets are flooded with diluted sewage.&nbsp; On such an
occasion I was crossing one of these gutters, when a
street-sweeper approached, holding his cap in one hand and his
broom in the other, and asked me to remember &ldquo;an old
shipmate, your honour.&rdquo;&nbsp; I soon recognised him as our
old friend &ldquo;Tall and Fat&rdquo;.&nbsp; I could not help
looking surprised, whereat he assured me he had found a most
excellent berth as a street-sweeper&mdash;that none but gentlemen
were engaged in the &ldquo;profession,&rdquo; all being Oxford or
Cambridge men&mdash;the wages being 7s. per day.&nbsp; I asked
after his friend &ldquo;Short and Stout.&rdquo;&nbsp; He said he
held a similar appointment at an adjoining corner, and he
promised to share my gratuity with him.</p>
<p>The country between Melbourne and Ballarat is flat and
somewhat uninteresting, but near the latter city it becomes more
hilly and diversified.&nbsp; Ballarat is a well-built city,
containing about 40,000 inhabitants.&nbsp; A few years ago there
were 10,000 more, but in consequence of the alluvial gold
becoming exhausted a considerable exodus took place.&nbsp; The
streets are wide, and have trees on each side; in some there are
trees in the middle as well.&nbsp; The houses are substantially
built of stone or brick, and altogether it has the air of being a
busy and prosperous place.</p>
<p>We visited one of the gold mines, and as we approached the
office saw three persons coming towards it, one of them carrying
a parcel, which appeared to be heavy.&nbsp; It proved to be a
brick of gold weighing 33 lbs., and worth about &pound;1,200,
being the result of one week&rsquo;s <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>working.&nbsp; We were shown the
various processes of obtaining the gold from the quartz, and were
rather surprised at the somewhat primitive character of the
machinery employed.</p>

<p>Several of the companies with big-sounding names occupy spaces
of only 60ft. by 50ft., and yet yield substantial returns.&nbsp;
One such little patch is part of the Church land, and is called
&ldquo;Hallelujah Claim,&rdquo; in honour of the Church.&nbsp;
The total value of gold raised in Australia up to end of 1879 was
275 millions sterling.</p>
<p>One of the prettiest features of this handsome city is a fine
sheet of water called Lake Wendouree.&nbsp; This lake is about a
mile across, and lies in the crater of an extinct volcano.&nbsp;
The Botanical Gardens are on the farther side of Wendouree, which
has a fine boulevard round each side leading thereto.&nbsp; On
the lake are <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>several pretty little steamers, which make frequent
excursions.&nbsp; In the evening they are provided with coloured
lamps, and music and dances may be enjoyed by the
passengers.&nbsp; Ballarat is less than thirty years old, yet has
quite an old-world appearance.&nbsp; It is a charming city and
well worth a visit, and we were well pleased to have seen it.</p>
<p>A favourite excursion from Melbourne is to the Black Spur
Mountains, about two days&rsquo; drive from the city.&nbsp;
Leaving Melbourne the route passes through some miles of suburban
villa residences with beautiful gardens.&nbsp; After about ten
miles &ldquo;the bush&rdquo; is reached, and continues for the
remainder of the journey, relieved here and there by a clearing
or by a little village.&nbsp; The term &ldquo;bush&rdquo; must
not be understood as scrub, furze, etc., but all kinds of
uncultivated land, thick forests, and open country.&nbsp; A
curious feature of colonial life is to see in full operation the
old stage coaches, so long ago discarded in England.&nbsp; They
are painted a brilliant red, and indeed appear to be the
veritable machines used in the &ldquo;good old days when George
the Third was king.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are frequently drawn by six
or more horses, and, true to their ancient traditions, now and
then have a spill, for roadmakers in the Colonies have the same
habit as their English brethren of making short &ldquo;right
about turns&rdquo; at the bottom of steep hills.&nbsp; We drew up
at a small wayside inn, intending to bait the horses, but found
it was closed, owing to the death of the landlord.&nbsp; This man
was a large wine grower, and his vineyards extended for a
considerable distance round his house.&nbsp; After passing
through many miles of country under vine cultivation we <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>pulled up for
the night at a little village called Healesville, where a very
miscellaneous company sat down to a substantial repast, ending
with what the waiter called a &ldquo;soafler.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
light being dim it was difficult to see what the dish really was,
and curiosity being awakened, inquiry elicited the fact that it
was intended for a souffl&eacute;.&nbsp; The hotel being quite
full of visitors, two of our party had to sleep in the parlour on
sofas of the horse-hair order.&nbsp; The landlord, coming in to
see if we were all right, informed us we could not have our boots
cleaned in the morning, as his man was just then out on a
boose.&nbsp; A colonial friend travelling with us remarked that
it was &ldquo;awkward when master or man took to
boosing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our friend had previously told us that the
landlord was generally &ldquo;on that line.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;You never saw me boosy!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Never</i>!&rdquo; retorted our friend, with peculiar
emphasis, which summarily stopped the discussion.&nbsp; We were
awakened early in the morning by the screams of laughing
jackasses and the crowing of cocks.&nbsp; Our toilette was
performed somewhat under difficulties, one of us having to use
the piano as a washstand, and another being constrained to go
through the same operation in the open street under the hotel
verandah.&nbsp; Our route now lay over a steep hill, through a
forest of gum trees, the fragrance arising from the latter in the
early morning air being delightfully refreshing.&nbsp; The main
roads are kept very fairly, a certain number of men being told
off for each section at 9s. per day wages.&nbsp; The old corduroy
roads, formed by laying trees across the track and filling the
interstices with earth, are being gradually superseded by
Macadam.&nbsp; The men seemed <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>to work in very leisurely
fashion.&nbsp; We were to have breakfasted at a cottage on the
road, but when we arrived there found that the old lady who kept
it had gone to a ball at some village public-house, several miles
away, as also had the owners of all the other cottages along the
route.&nbsp; A little girl left in charge told us that after the
ball all these good people were going to the funeral of the wine
grower and innkeeper previously mentioned, and our friend told us
they would doubtless stay there to comfort the widow as long as
there was any wine left in the house.&nbsp; We soon after entered
the region of the big gum trees and of the tree ferns, and a
wonderfully beautiful sight it was.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p52.jpg">
<img alt=
"A Big Tree"
title=
"A Big Tree"
src="images/p52.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The whole valley is filled with tree ferns, and the fronds, in
many cases being new, with the sunlight falling upon them, formed
a picture not soon to be forgotten.&nbsp; <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Some of the
gum trees were enormously large&mdash;we saw several 15ft. in
diameter and over 200ft. in height&mdash;but these were small
when compared with some found in the less frequented parts.&nbsp;
In the midst of such surroundings lies the pretty little village
of Fernshaw.&nbsp; When we were first invited to spend a week at
the country house of our friend we rather unreasonably pictured
in our minds an English country or seaside residence, and
anticipated much pleasure in the change from dusty
Melbourne.&nbsp; Our surprise was great, therefore, when after
jolting over some half-formed roads we came upon a clearing among
the gum trees, and were told that the wooden shanty before us was
the Melbourne citizen&rsquo;s country house.&nbsp; We were not
disposed, however, to be very critical, for the sixty miles drive
in the mountain air had made us hungry, and we were quite ready
to respond to the invitation to the evening meal.&nbsp; But our
disillusion was complete upon entering the sitting room and
finding that no provision had been made for the satisfying of our
keen appetites.&nbsp; By some accident the supplies from
Melbourne had not arrived; the rough table was covered with a
couple of towels, and on it was spread a repast consisting of
some bad bread and sour raspberry jam, while the &ldquo;cup which
cheers but not inebriates&rdquo; was innocent of milk and
sugar.&nbsp; It was Saturday evening and we were &ldquo;out of
humanity&rsquo;s reach,&rdquo; being many miles from any source
of supply, so had to content ourselves as best we might with this
Spartan fare until the Monday, when our host proposed an
excursion to a distant part, involving the staying a night at an
hotel.&nbsp; We gladly embraced the proposal, and finding that
the <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>hotel
was a comfortable one I determined to excuse myself from joining
in the excursion on the following day in order that I might have
the opportunity of recruiting nature&rsquo;s exhausted powers by
an extra meal, a resolution I had much satisfaction in carrying
into effect.&nbsp; Our friend and his sons own about one thousand
acres, at present covered with trees, with the exception of a
small clearing round the house.&nbsp; When a piece of land is
taken, the first care is to fence it, which is done with logs, at
a cost of &pound;25 per mile, including the cutting of the
logs.&nbsp; The next step is to &ldquo;ring&rdquo; the
trees&mdash;that is, to cut a deep groove round them, and so by
killing them prevent any further exhaustion of the soil.&nbsp;
The trees being dead, vegetation rapidly springs up, and there is
soon abundance of food for cattle.&nbsp; Clearing the ground of
trees and stumps is a very costly operation, and takes many years
to finally accomplish.&nbsp; The Government with a view of
preventing the accumulation of lands in a few hands, refuse to
sell more than 320 acres to one person, but of course this is
easily evaded.&nbsp; At the time of our visit the price was
&pound;1 per acre, payable in ten years by equal instalments, a
condition being that some one should reside upon the
allotment.&nbsp; At the end of three years the owner can obtain
from Government a lease of the land, and can then pay up the full
value, which leaves him at liberty to sell if he wishes to do
so.&nbsp; Of course the building up of large estates is thus
encouraged, but this could, perhaps, be prevented by imposing a
tax on every acre.&nbsp; The 20,000 acre men would soon be
compelled to dispose of some of the land which they hold in the
expectation that it will <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>increase in value.&nbsp; Such a plan
has been proposed, but it naturally met with great opposition
from the landed interest.</p>

<p>Leaving our friend&rsquo;s house a drive of a few miles
through the bush brought us to the picturesquely-situated village
of Marysville.&nbsp; This little village lies in a deep hollow
surrounded by fine ranges of tree-clad hills of extreme
beauty.&nbsp; A pleasant hour&rsquo;s walk from the village,
under the shade of the tree ferns, took us to the Stephenson
Falls.&nbsp; The principal fall is 80ft., and the volume of water
is unusually large for an Australian waterfall.&nbsp; Close to
the fall are some magnificently large tree ferns, and while
sitting here enjoying the lovely view some little birds came
flitting about, one of them hopping on to the shoulder of one of
our party, attracted, doubtless, by the aroma of a fragrant
&ldquo;weed&rdquo; which at the time he was enjoying.&nbsp;
English visitors to Australia, especially those in search of
health, would find the conditions existing at Marysville most
conducive to their restoration.&nbsp; The air is bracing, and as
before stated, the scenery most delightful.&nbsp; A tolerably
good accommodation is to be had at the inn, which will doubtless
be improved as the place becomes more widely known.</p>
<p>Returning to Melbourne, we stayed another night at
Healesville, arriving at 7.30, and as we had fared badly during
the day we were quite ready for a substantial dinner, and from
our previous experience of the house made no doubt of obtaining
it.&nbsp; But unfortunately for us, there had been a chapel
tea-party during the afternoon, at which a large force of parsons
had been present.&nbsp; We had therefore to be content with a
tough, <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>woody steak, a wild duck of ancient and fish-like smell,
varied by salted mutton.&nbsp; The butter was rancid and full of
dead flies, and the bread appeared to have been cast upon the
waters.&nbsp; We had to go to bed feeling quite faint, but hoping
for a better breakfast.&nbsp; The beds were good, and we should
have had a good night&rsquo;s rest, which we sorely needed after
the twig beds of the previous night at the Marysville Hotel, but
the partitions between the rooms being only of half-inch plank
everything passing around us could be heard all too
plainly.&nbsp; A little after midnight some fellows came in from
night-fishing, and going into the room next ours woke us up by a
great noise.&nbsp; One old donkey was telling the two younger
ones he had had a deal of experience among snakes, killing as
many as eight a day for many years, and that as the result of a
series of experiments during that time he had found an infallible
cure for snake bites.&nbsp; He had offered his discovery to the
Government for &pound;1,000, and his partner offered to be
poisoned by the most deadly snakes to test its efficacy, but all
to no purpose.&nbsp; So he had determined to let the secret die
with him.&nbsp; The others asked if the sovereign remedy was to
be swallowed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the old fellow,
&ldquo;for it is composed of five deadly poisons.&nbsp; You must
first cut out the wounded part, and rub the antidote in.&nbsp;
But,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;the secret shall now die with
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But how about your partner?&rdquo; asked
the others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he tell the
secret?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; was the reply;
&ldquo;he&rsquo;s safe enough, for he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then we heard the voice of the landlord&rsquo;s pretty daughter
telling them it was time to go to sleep, upon which the old boy
growled, <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>&ldquo;I wonder people can&rsquo;t go to sleep without
bothering me.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rest of the night was made
miserable for us by the two &ldquo;night fishers,&rdquo; who,
rising long before dawn, went prowling about the different rooms,
ours included, collecting their tackle for a shooting expedition,
but leaving behind them, as we found afterwards, their percussion
caps.</p>

<p>We returned to Melbourne by another route, affording us some
fine views of the plains called Yarra Flats, and the Marysville
Hills in the far distance.</p>
<h2><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>At the end of January we left Melbourne for a few weeks&rsquo;
tour in Tasmania, taking steamer from the wharf on the Yarra
Yarra, the river upon which the capital of Victoria is
situated.</p>
<p>The banks of the Yarra have been selected as the scene of the
operations of all the most offensive trades in the
colony&mdash;the bone boilers, tanners, fellmongers, candle
makers, chemical manure makers, glue manufacturers, etc., in
addition to which all the sewage which is not left on the surface
of the streets is run into it.&nbsp; The river is very narrow,
the fall to the sea extremely slight, and the traffic great,
hence at every revolution of the paddle-wheel or screw-propeller
the abominations from the depths below are stirred up and mingled
with those coming from the before-named savoury factories,
forming a more horrible compound than ever proceeded from
witches&rsquo; cauldron.&nbsp; In this one respect the New World
has certainly shot far ahead of the old, for even the memory of
ancient Cologne is made savoury to the nostrils by this colonial
stench.</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Our
friends came to say good-bye, and brought quite a sack of peaches
and apricots, which were very acceptable during the voyage.&nbsp;
If there were on board any roysterers or betting men they had no
opportunity for displaying their peculiarities.&nbsp; Until we
reached the entrance to the river Tamar almost every person on
board was ill, for Bass&rsquo;s Straits is notorious for its
disagreeable cross seas.</p>
<p>Launceston is forty miles up the river, and is the capital of
the county of Cornwall, as in England.&nbsp; The scenery along
the river banks is very beautiful, and is so exactly like the
Truro river at home that it is difficult to believe we are out of
England.&nbsp; The river is winding and broad, and the shores
slope gently down from high ground covered with trees.&nbsp; Here
and there are bright green meadows and villages and scattered
farmsteads and churches.&nbsp; I saw nothing in Victoria to
compare with it.</p>
<p>Launceston, a quiet city of 10,000 inhabitants, is surrounded
by hills.&nbsp; Looking down upon it, one is reminded of Florence
from Fiesole, the beautiful climate and clear air being quite
Italian, with the lovely Tamar winding its circuitous route for
miles away.&nbsp; We drove out towards a place called the
&ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Punch Bowl,&rdquo; walking the last mile
through a beautiful wood down a hill, with firs, gum trees, etc.,
in abundance, with here and there delightful glimpses of green
glades.&nbsp; The air was filled with the sounds of the tree
locusts and the tremendous hissing noise of the cicadas, the sun
shining through the trees and producing a temperature and light
which were simply perfect.&nbsp; The only drawback is the
presence of snakes, which, our driver said, are very <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>abundant
here.&nbsp; The scene is truly English.&nbsp; At the bottom of
the little wooded valley we came upon an old wooden shanty, where
we tried to get a glass of milk, but there was no one at
home.&nbsp; Presently an old man appeared, driving cows.&nbsp; We
asked him for milk&mdash;he had none, but gave us water, and
offered raw eggs.&nbsp; My companion took two, and said he liked
them, but I am sure he liked the first best.&nbsp; The old man
was seventy-three years of age, and lived there alone, sleeping
on a door covered with an opossum rug.&nbsp; He told us his
master died there close by the bee-hives a few weeks ago,
&ldquo;so,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I put the bees in deep
mourning, or they would all have left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wrote my notes sitting on a gatepost, out of the way of
snakes; the moon shone brightly, and in the distance I could hear
the church bells, mingled with the voices of children, the
tinkling of cowbells, and barking of dogs.</p>
<p>The shops close at six o&rsquo;clock, but the public-houses of
course remain open.&nbsp; I observed a small fruit-shop, a mere
shanty, with the sign of &ldquo;Pomona&rsquo;s Temple,&rdquo; and
a hairdresser&rsquo;s saloon with the high-sounding name of
&ldquo;Tonsorial Palace,&rdquo; while a democratic opponent in
the same street, with a proud humility, called his place of
business a &ldquo;Barber&rsquo;s Shop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strolling in the town one evening I talked with a policeman,
who was an almost exact counterpart of Count Moltke.&nbsp; He had
just received his new regulation helmet, and did not like it at
all: it was hard and heavy.&nbsp; He was very pleased to hear we
liked Tasmania better than Victoria.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;you will find real hospitality here; here everybody
helps everybody, but <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>in Melbourne everybody helps himself,
and the bobby or somebody catches the hindmost.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
said he had been a policeman for twenty years, and,
&ldquo;although I say it as shouldn&rsquo;t, I will say for the
Launceston police, they are the most civillest, honestest body of
policemen going,&rdquo; with which I quite agreed.</p>
<p>Another beautiful ride is to the Cora Linn, seven miles from
Launceston.&nbsp; On one side of the road, stretching almost the
whole distance, is a hedge of sweetbriar, giving forth delicious
perfume.&nbsp; It is difficult to get accustomed to the reversal
of the seasons; here in February the farmers are busy cutting and
saving their corn, but with no fear of rain to spoil their
harvest, as in England.&nbsp; A bridge crosses the Linn, and a
cataract-like stream tumbles down over rocks, very much like the
Lynn at Lynmouth.&nbsp; Below the bridge is a deep basin, and all
around are numbers of queer trees, young and old, with many
burnt-out trunks black as negroes, with white spots in them like
eyes.&nbsp; The trees and shrubs are full of <i>cicadas</i>
making a great noise.</p>
<p>Leaving Launceston, we drove to Falmouth, ninety miles
away.&nbsp; The road lies through a beautifully-wooded country;
indeed, the entire ride is just like going through a park in
England.&nbsp; We saw lots of magpies, very much larger than
ours, but quite as mischievous.&nbsp; A gentleman told us a
person once asked him to change a sovereign, which he did, and
then looked for the sovereign, but it could not be seen.&nbsp;
Presently, looking up, he saw Master Mag in a shrub, with one eye
shut, his head on one side, and standing on one leg, with the
piece of gold in his mouth.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Our
first night&rsquo;s stopping-place was at Stoney Creek, where
there is a comfortable hotel, just like a private house, with
only one other house for miles around.&nbsp; Near to the hotel
flows the River Esk, a black, silent, swiftly-flowing and
suicidal-looking stream, suggestive in its motion of some huge
black snake, of which there are many in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
In crossing a field to look at the river our clothes became
covered with burrs and spines from the prickly pear.&nbsp; We sat
down on a grassy mound to watch the flowing of the river, but had
quickly to move, as we found ourselves in the midst of a colony
of great ants.&nbsp; The following verses were written on the
occasion by one of my companions:</p>

<p>The landlady was a widow, her husband having recently
died.&nbsp; Her son had just returned from sea, where he had been
for twelve years.&nbsp; He had been wrecked three times, and the
last time should have given him enough of the sea for the rest of
his life.&nbsp; It was in the ship &ldquo;Euxine,&rdquo; taking
3,000 tons of coal to the Mauritius.&nbsp; She took fire off the
Cape of Good Hope in the midst of a terrific storm.&nbsp; The
captain was washed overboard and drowned; a sailor was also swept
away, and while only twenty feet from the ship was attacked by a
flock of albatrosses, right in sight of his comrades.&nbsp; He
fought with them, but all in vain, and the wretches literally
pulled him in pieces with their strong bills in a very few
minutes.&nbsp; The crew got out the boats, but of course they
were in a bad state.&nbsp; It was, however, a choice between
burning and drowning, so they put off, preferring to risk the
latter.&nbsp; After two or three days, two of the boats were
picked up, but the third was out for eleven days.&nbsp; The poor
wretches on board had nothing whatever to eat, and in their
extremity were driven to cast lots which among them should
die.&nbsp; One unhappy man was disposed of, and in two hours
after a ship came in sight and picked them up.</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>A
lovely drive through Epping Forest brought us to Avoca, where
&ldquo;the bright waters meet,&rdquo; the North and South Esk
uniting here.&nbsp; Our route lay along a fine road, through
avenues of gum trees, wattles (acacias), cultivated for their
bark, the sweetbriars and hawthorns scenting the air
delightfully.&nbsp; We saw a splendid eagle, and large numbers of
parrots, magpies, and hawks.</p>

<p>On our way we passed many residences of great woolgrowers,
owning as much as 20,000 acres of land each, but living, for the
most part, in England, their affairs in the Colony being managed
by agents.&nbsp; They keep only one man on each 5,000
acres.&nbsp; There is scarcely any agriculture, although the land
is very suitable, but being taken up in this way, there is no
room for population to increase, and the people have to
emigrate.</p>
<p>At Fingal we stopped at an hotel, kept by an Irishman married
to a Jewess.&nbsp; They presided at either end of the table, and
kept us short of food; indeed, I never saw a <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>small joint
go so far before.&nbsp; Next day we left the hotel, still hungry,
although the charges were quite as high as those at the Great
Western Hotel, Paddington.</p>
<p>Soon after leaving Fingal we saw something by the roadside
which looked very like a snake, and on examining it we found it
was one&mdash;a black snake, 4ft. 6in. long.&nbsp; It lay
perfectly still, and presently we found it was dead; but the
sensation was not pleasant.&nbsp; A gentleman at the hotel told
us he had killed four the night previously, and doubtless this
was one of them.</p>

<p>After passing through the charming village of St.
Mary&rsquo;s, embowered in trees, we entered a lovely avenue, two
miles in length, filled with beautiful flowers and ferns, the air
laden with scents from the gum and other trees, and on emerging
came upon St. Mary&rsquo;s Pass.&nbsp; This is an immense gorge,
four miles long, filled with fine trees, the road, which is
remarkably good, being cut in the side of the cliff by convicts
in the old days of Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land.&nbsp; It winds down
the valley to the sea at Falmouth, and on either side rise lofty
hills, while the valley below is 1,000 feet deep, and filled with
immense trees of various kinds, including the tree fern.&nbsp; I
have seen most of the passes and valleys in the Tyrol, but have
never seen one to excel this in grandeur or beauty.</p>

<p>In the map the word &ldquo;Falmouth&rdquo; was printed in
rather large letters, so we expected to find a somewhat
considerable place.&nbsp; At the head of the pass we were told
the township lay between the foot of the hill and the sea.&nbsp;
On getting down the hill we could plainly view the sea and the
intervening land, but no town was visible.&nbsp; Inquiring of
some little boys the way to Falmouth, they directed us away to
the right.&nbsp; We went on, feeling assured we were going wrong;
and presently, meeting a gentleman, we inquired again, when he
told <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>us to
retrace our course, to go through an ordinary field gate, and
that we should then get to Falmouth in three minutes!&nbsp; We
told him that the little boys had directed us the other way, but
he said we should have asked for &ldquo;Hotel.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
town of Falmouth, where the boys lived, consisted of two or three
houses, and was a mile from the hotel.&nbsp; On exploring the
place next day we were informed that fifty years before it was
much more important than now.&nbsp; Miles of streets were marked
out, but were grass-grown, and there were not more than a dozen
houses in the place, all built of wood, and of one storey in
height.&nbsp; The burying-place for the district is about a mile
away, on the open common, each grave being surrounded with
stakes, with no wall or fence enclosing the whole.&nbsp; It was a
melancholy sight, reminding me strongly of the graves on the
battlefields of the Franco-German war.</p>

<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>The
beach and sands are very fine, like those of my native
county.&nbsp; The bathing is delightful, but you must keep a
sharp look out for sharks.&nbsp; One morning, however, while
bathing, we stood in much greater danger from the mad folly of
some Cockneys who had recently come to the hotel.&nbsp; We had
been bathing in an arm of the sea, the point beyond which it was
not safe being marked by a stake driven into the sand.&nbsp;
Between our bathing place and the hotel was a high sand bank,
screening us from sight, the stake being visible from the
verandah of the hotel.&nbsp; After dressing, we were leisurely
walking up the sandbank towards the hotel, when we were startled
by a bullet passing between our heads and lodging in the sand
behind us!&nbsp; We threw up our towels and shouted, and then saw
the Cockney sportsman standing on the platform under the
verandah, from whence he had been aiming at the stake in the sand
with his rifle for the past half hour.&nbsp; On examination we
found the sand riddled with bullets, not 50ft. from where we had
been bathing.&nbsp; The little burying ground possessed a new
significance in our eyes after this incident.&nbsp; We found some
beautiful sea-shells during a delightful walk along the beach
towards Swansea, and on our return called upon the gentleman who
put us right for Falmouth on our arrival.&nbsp; He is a farmer
from near Oxford, and had been here seven or eight years, finding
it a terribly lonely place.&nbsp; Recently his nine children and
his servants took the measles, and his wife being ill, he had to
nurse them all.&nbsp; When they got well his wife sickened and
died, leaving him with seven daughters and two sons, the eldest
being only fourteen years old.&nbsp; The nearest doctor lived
more than thirty miles away.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>In
order to get to Hobart Town, we had to retrace our steps some
sixty miles, as there is only one road on this side of the
island.&nbsp; We stayed a night at Avoca, a charming place, but
the roads were a foot deep in dust.&nbsp; Although the climate is
so fine, and everything favours the growth of fruit, there is
very little grown.&nbsp; It is alleged that fruit trees do not
prosper, but I had ample evidence that the cause is to be found
in the indifference or laziness of the people.&nbsp; Strolling in
the neighbourhood of the village, we came upon a beautiful
orchard, and were admiring the large, ripe plums, when a voice
behind said, &ldquo;Walk in, gentlemen, and help
yourselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; The speaker was a hearty old man, who
had lived here forty-six years.&nbsp; He came from Ledbury, and
was much interested in hearing about Birmingham.&nbsp; He told us
that the day before he left England he walked from Ledbury to
Birmingham to see the Nelson statue in the Bull Ring.</p>
<p>The old man told us a snake story, which strikingly
illustrates the vitality of these reptiles.&nbsp; A short time
previously he and his son went across a neighbouring mountain on
horseback to visit one of their farms.&nbsp; Going &ldquo;single
file&rdquo; between the trees, the son, who was leading, suddenly
called out to his father, &ldquo;Look out, there&rsquo;s a
snake,&rdquo; and at the same instant his horse started.&nbsp;
The old gentleman got off, and finding it was a &ldquo;carpet
snake,&rdquo;&mdash;one of the most venomous species&mdash;caught
up a stick, and aimed a blow at it.&nbsp; The stick however was
rotten, and broke without hurting the reptile, which now prepared
to strike; but the old man managed to get his heel upon its head,
and ground it into the earth; and having, as he thought, killed
it, tied a <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>piece of string around its middle, and bending a wattle
tree down, attached the end of the string to one of the branches,
and then released the tree.&nbsp; They thought no more of the
matter until three days after, when two of his men, returning
from his farm with a cart, were seen by their master dragging a
snake behind the cart.&nbsp; He asked them where they caught it;
they explained that while coming down the hill side, their
attention was arrested by a snake in a tree clashing towards
them, but unable to release itself.&nbsp; On examination, they
found it was tied up!&nbsp; &ldquo;So that after all,&rdquo; said
the old man, &ldquo;it was only scotched, not killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fellow-traveller on the coach told us that he was coming
from the tin mines near Mount Bischoff, and that for some months
he and his partner had slept in hammocks slung from trees.&nbsp;
One night, just as he was going to sleep, something dropped from
the tree across his body.&nbsp; He took it in his hand, and
finding it was a snake, he flung it from him, when it alighted on
his companion.&nbsp; Luckily, both escaped unhurt.&nbsp; He also
told me of the experience of a friend of his, a Government
surveyor, who was frequently in the woods for weeks together,
with one or two men.&nbsp; This gentleman slept in a hammock
suspended from trees.&nbsp; The hammock was in reality a sack,
hanging some feet from the ground, into which he got at
night.&nbsp; One night he had retired as usual, and being very
wearied, did not at once notice that there was independent
movement at his feet.&nbsp; Very soon, however, he realised the
fact that a snake had gone to bed before him, and was coiling
itself round his legs.&nbsp; The gentleman quickly got out,
unhurt, and soon killed the snake.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>I also
read in a colonial paper another account of a night adventure
with a snake.&nbsp; A lady had retired to rest, and was fast
asleep; the weather being very hot, one of her arms was outside
the clothes, and during the night she was awakened by feeling
something trying to force its way between her arm and her side;
she quickly realised the situation, and without moving, tightly
pressed her arm against her body and prevented the venomous
reptile from getting between, when presently it glided over her
shoulder and fell on the floor with a thud.&nbsp; She was soon
out of bed at the other end, and calling for help and a light the
snake was quickly despatched.</p>
<p>The doctor in this place has charge of a district sixty miles
in diameter, and always expects his fees before leaving his
house; but although he has so large a district, I question if he
makes his fortune, for although acres are many, people are few,
and the salubrity of the climate does not favour the medical
profession.</p>
<p>The main road between Launceston and Hobart is struck at
Willis&rsquo;s Corner, a few miles from Campbelltown&mdash;the
principal town in the interior of the island.&nbsp; There is a
station here on the main-line railway.&nbsp; The gauge of the
line is thirty-nine inches, I think.</p>
<p>Campbelltown is a straggling place, with streets enough laid
out for a city, but with only few houses, and it is not likely
many more will be built, as the railway is expected to take away
its trade, which depends mainly upon the coach traffic.&nbsp; The
streets are about one hundred and twenty feet wide, which is
greatly in excess of all requirements, and causes the traffic <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>to run in
ruts, instead of being distributed over the roadway, giving a
desolate appearance to the whole place.&nbsp; As a rule, the
Tasmanian roads are very good, having been made in the old days
by convict labour, but you must not venture to mention the word
&ldquo;convict;&rdquo; the people all speak of these public works
as having been executed by Government.&nbsp; Having had so much
done for them by the Government, the Tasmanian people are lacking
in energy, and are much too prone to rely upon outside help; and
yet when Melbourne people come over to invest capital in mines
and other industries, the cry is that the strangers are taking
all the money out of the country.&nbsp; As I have said, the farms
are of a great size, but the number of men engaged are but
few.&nbsp; The farmers have two great enemies&mdash;the thistle
and the rabbit.&nbsp; It is said the former was introduced into
the colonies by a patriotic Scotchman, to remind him of his
bonnie Scotland, the rabbit being introduced for the purpose of
sport; but, like our old friend the sparrow, they have so
increased as to be the cause of serious loss, and are the
subjects of special legislation.&nbsp; Some landowners spend many
thousands of pounds in putting walls around their estates to keep
the rabbits out.</p>
<p>From Campbelltown to Hobart is seventy-six miles, and we rode
the whole distance in a single day.&nbsp; The country is very
beautiful, and towards the end of the journey we had fine
mountain and river scenery.&nbsp; The Derwent is a splendid
river, running through a lovely country, sometimes through rich
pasture lands and hop gardens, and at other times between high
precipices and rugged country.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Mount
Wellington is a remarkably fine mountain of 4,000 feet in height,
and is topped with snow for a considerable portion of the
winter.</p>

<p>Villages are very scarce on the road, and shops few, so the
inhabitants get most of their requirements from hawkers, who
visit all parts of the island with horses and vans, carrying all
kinds of goods.&nbsp; We passed several with their wares spread
out on the ground.&nbsp; Our coachman told us rather a good story
of two of these &ldquo;merchants,&rdquo; as they are usually
called.&nbsp; These men travelled the road together as partners,
having a standing agreement between them that only one should get
drunk at a time, so that they were not unfrequently seen riding,
one of them as drunk as a lord or a <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>fiddler, while the other was
perfectly sober, but merry.&nbsp; One day, however, they broke
the rule, and both got drunk together, letting their horse go
just as it liked.&nbsp; Unhappily, as they were turning a corner
in the road, a coach came bowling along and ran into them,
breaking their van and many of their bones, besides spoiling most
of their stock-in-trade.&nbsp; The coachman could not tell us if
the accident had the effect of making the men teetotallers.</p>

<p>Hobart (as Hobart Town is now called) is most beautifully
situated, with extensive public gardens, charmingly laid out, and
having the advantage of an abundance of water from the River
Derwent.&nbsp; The Governor&rsquo;s house is admirably placed,
commanding extensive views of river and mountain scenery.&nbsp;
The citizens are exceedingly hospitable, and we were not long at
the hotel before we were visited by a gentleman who informed us
he had entered our names on the books of the principal club, and
also invited us to a grand representation of
&ldquo;Martha.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are many charming excursions in
the neighbourhood of Hobart.&nbsp; One of <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>the most
beautiful is to New Norfolk, about two and a half hours&rsquo;
steam up the Derwent river.&nbsp; As we approach New Norfolk the
river gets very narrow, and we pass through a part called
&ldquo;Hell Gates,&rdquo; having steep lofty cliffs on one side,
and a beautiful tongue of land with trees and lovely green grass
on the other.&nbsp; The name I thought particularly ill
chosen.</p>
<p>The village of New Norfolk is prettily situated among the
hills, with the lovely Derwentwater at its feet.&nbsp; Its
principal industry is the growing of hops.&nbsp; We went into the
gardens, and saw the people busily picking the hops, which were
very fine.</p>
<p>Another beautiful excursion is to Fern Tree Valley, a lovely
spot with a fine avenue of tree ferns, and with many immense gum
trees in the surrounding woods.</p>
<p>There being no steamer to Sydney or Melbourne for a week, we
drove over the road to Launceston, 120 miles distant.&nbsp; Soon
after leaving Hobart we crossed the River Jordan, passed through
Jericho, near to Jerusalem, stopping at Bagdad for breakfast.</p>
<p>Although February had just gone, the weather was still
intensely hot.&nbsp; The harvest was nearly over, and the wheat
looked beautiful.&nbsp; I saw some eight feet high, and a person
told me he had frequently seen it grow as high as ten feet.&nbsp;
Lunching at Melton Mowbray, we came on to Oatlands, driving the
last few miles by moonlight, the night being very cool.</p>
<p>At Oatlands is a large gaol, where in old times a number of
England&rsquo;s sons were confined, many of them having been sent
there for political &ldquo;offences,&rdquo; which in our happier
times have conducted the best <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>of Englishmen to the Council Board at
Windsor.&nbsp; The gaol is now almost untenanted.&nbsp; In
passing along we saw the ruins of many of the miserable old
barracks, where the convicts used to live.&nbsp; Everything looks
half finished, and I have scarcely seen one window blind
furnished with cords for winding; they roll them up and pin them,
consequently the blind is full of pin holes.&nbsp; We stopped a
night at the best hotel in Campbelltown, a really well-appointed
house; but on trying to open the front door, the knob came off in
my hand!&nbsp; We greatly enjoyed our three weeks&rsquo; stay in
Tasmania; in many respects it is more interesting than the
mainland, while the climate is much more agreeable to
Englishmen.&nbsp; A pleasant passage of twenty hours brought us
to Melbourne again, and the weather being still very hot, we
decided to go on to Sydney by steamer.</p>

<p>The run down Hobson&rsquo;s Bay to Port Philip Heads takes
about four hours, and just inside the mouth of the harbour are
two little watering-places, much frequented by the citizens of
Melbourne.</p>
<p>Presently we come to a curious feature in the water.&nbsp; The
currents of the bay and those of the open sea meet, and produce
at their junction the phenomenon locally known as &ldquo;The
Rip.&rdquo;&nbsp; All at once, as the steamer comes out of the
bay, we pass from smooth water into the regular waves of the sea;
there is almost a wall between, and as the vessel passes through
it a rushing sound is heard, the vessel instantly beginning to
roll and pitch.&nbsp; In rough weather passing through &ldquo;The
Rip&rdquo; is quite exciting, the water frequently rushing over
the decks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=
"Sydney Harbour"

"Sydney Harbour"
src="images/p81.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>After a voyage of a little more than two days, we arrived
outside the heads of Port Jackson or Sydney Harbour.&nbsp;
Everyone has heard of the extreme beauty <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>of this
glorious harbour; indeed if the visitor stays a few days in the
city he is likely to hear of it many times.&nbsp; The entrance is
about a mile in width, between bold cliffs 250 feet in
height.&nbsp; It has a coast line of more than 100 miles, and is
full of beautiful creeks and bays, with their banks finely wooded
to the water&rsquo;s edge, and having numerous handsome villas
picturesquely placed upon every point of vantage, the city being
situated at the head of the bay.&nbsp; The old town of Sydney is
very badly laid out, with narrow, crooked streets, while the
pavements and roads are most execrable, and the drainage and
water supply are as bad as they can well be.&nbsp; The public
buildings, and the modern portion of the city, are very fine, the
post-office in particular being a very handsome edifice,
infinitely superior to the new post-office in Birmingham; but
then the citizens of Sydney built their own, while the citizens
of Birmingham were not consulted, and had to accept what the
London architect was graciously pleased to bestow.</p>
<p>Next to the harbour, the public gardens of Sydney form its
principal attraction.&nbsp; The Botanical Gardens are exceedingly
fine, and contain a magnificent collection of almost every known
tree that will stand the climate.&nbsp; A special feature is the
Norfolk Island pine, which grows to a great height, perfectly
straight, and with very regular branches.&nbsp; The gardens are
finely situated on undulating ground, sloping down to the
harbour, which is sufficiently deep 200 yards off to float
men-of-war.&nbsp; From these gardens a fine view of the
Governor&rsquo;s house and of other parts of the city is
obtained.&nbsp; There is also a beautiful view from the
Observatory Hill, which the Sydney people are justly <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>proud of, for
it can scarcely be equalled in any other part of the world.&nbsp;
The harbour, with its numerous islands, lies spread out before
the eyes, while the greatest animation is given to the scene by
the large number of little steamers, yachts, and sail-boats
continually flitting about, for the youth of Sydney are truly
British in their love of the water.&nbsp; While we were admiring
this panorama one morning, an old gentleman, observing we were
strangers, pointed out the various objects of interest.&nbsp;
Presently one of our party observing a strange cloud in the
hitherto cloudless sky, called the old man&rsquo;s attention to
it.&nbsp; At first he thought it was a bush fire away to the
south, but in a minute he said, &ldquo;Come on, we had better get
under shelter, for it is a &lsquo;southerly
buster!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A &ldquo;southerly buster&rdquo; is one of the institutions of
Sydney, and is a hurricane of wind: which comes up suddenly from
the south, bringing clouds of dust from the brickfields lying on
that side of the city.&nbsp; We had long been wishing to see a
genuine example, and here it was with a vengeance.&nbsp; In less
time than it takes to describe, the whole city and harbour were
completely obscured by a tremendous cloud of dust, blown on at a
great pace, roaring like a furnace, and carrying before it
sticks, paper, and even small gravel, which strike with the force
of hailstones.&nbsp; During the twenty minutes which the
hurricane lasts umbrellas are perfectly useless, and every person
and thing becomes completely covered with dust.&nbsp; Having
experienced the &ldquo;buster&rdquo; once, we have no desire for
a repetition.</p>
<p>Sydney is fortunate in possessing almost inexhaustible
supplies of oysters, and the old gentleman referred <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>to above told
us they sometimes grew on trees!&nbsp; There is a tree called the
Mangrove, which grows very plentifully on the banks of the
Parramatta river; sometimes the water is very high for days
together, and the oyster spawn gets fixed in the mud on the
branches, and so they grow and are gathered in their season.</p>
<p>One of the most delightful excursions from Sydney is to the
top of the Blue Mountains, where there are several villages and
some exceedingly fine and interesting scenery.&nbsp; The summit
of the mountains is about 3,500ft. above sea-level, and is
seventy miles from Sydney, being reached by a picturesque zigzag
railway.&nbsp; In the old convict days it was commonly supposed
by the prisoners that China lay on the other side of the Blue
Mountain range, and many of the wretched men lost their lives in
the jungle in trying to escape to the celestial country; one
party succeeded in getting to a considerable distance before the
guard overtook them, and one of them was found to have in his
possession an engraving of a compass, by which he expected to
steer his way!</p>
<p>The railway from Sydney passes many charming villages and
extensive orange groves, crossing the River Nepean by a handsome
iron bridge.</p>
<p>Some of the hotels on the mountain are of a very primitive
character.&nbsp; One of those in which we stayed was a
single-storied building, with bed-rooms opening into the
yard.&nbsp; The house was built of planks, and the partitions
were not very thick.&nbsp; I found that the landlord was the
brother of an English tradesman with whom I do business.&nbsp;
They had not heard of one another <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>for forty years, which was a
suspicious circumstance, considering the history of the
colony.</p>

<p>In the fireplace of our sitting room we found a
&ldquo;gin&rdquo; set for rats, which during the night were quite
lively.&nbsp; One morning we observed that our waiter seemed to
be very anxious for us to finish our breakfast.&nbsp; Presently
he asked if we had finished with the coffee-pot, saying that all
the others had been sent to be mended, and as he had a rather
particular couple in the next room, he did not like to take in
the coffee in a tea-pot!</p>
<p>At Mount Victoria, the highest village on the mountain, there
are good State schools, to which the children come for
twenty-five miles round from the villages along the
railway.&nbsp; Both schools and railways in New South Wales
belong to the State, and the schoolchildren are allowed to ride
free by all trains.&nbsp; Even the goods trains have carriages
attached for the use of the children, and the school hours are
arranged to enable them to take advantage of the trains.&nbsp;
Mount Victoria is a beautiful village, where many of the wealthy
citizens of Sydney have charming residences.&nbsp; It has quite
an alpine appearance with its wooden houses and tree-clad
hills.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood are many delightful places, to
which excursions are made; one of the most interesting is to a
waterfall called &ldquo;Govett&rsquo;s Leap.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
road is a very rough one, and goes through the forest, in which
are numbers of large ant-hills more than 5ft. in height, and
formed of clay, which has become so hard that a stick makes no
impression upon them.&nbsp; The entrances for the little
creatures are very narrow cracks, too narrow for any of <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>their enemies
to get through.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, a creature called the
&ldquo;iguana&rdquo; manages to make its way inside, when he
always clears the entire colony out.</p>

</a></p>
<p>After a few miles&rsquo; drive along an almost level road, we
come suddenly upon the edge of a precipice nearly 1,000 feet
deep, down which the stream falls forming the waterfall.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;leap&rdquo; is about 500 feet, and almost all the
water becomes spray before it reaches the bottom, its appearance
reminding us of the Staubbach Falls at Lauterbrunnen.</p>
<p>From the precipice a fine view is obtained for many miles
round.&nbsp; The country is broken up into deep <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>ravines or
wide gullies, stretching as far as the eye can reach, and all
wooded, while, except the little waterfall, not a drop of water
is to be seen.</p>
<p>On the other side of Mount Victoria, towards Bathurst, is
another curious zigzag railway, at the foot of which is the
village of Lithgow, the seat of iron and coal industries.&nbsp;
At present the works are of a very primitive character, but I
have no doubt that at no distant date they will assume important
proportions.</p>

<p>Outside our hotel door the landlord kept his talking parrot,
which was always saying to the passers-by, &ldquo;a bucket of
beer, a bucket of beer.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a retired
missionary staying at the hotel with his wife, and one day the
old lady told me that she thought they might have taught the poor
thing something &ldquo;more Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>One
evening some drovers from Bathurst camped for the night near to
the hotel; they put their cattle into a field, and having taken
their tents from the packhorses, soon made themselves comfortable
round their camp-fires, the whole scene being very picturesque
and gipsy-like.</p>
<p>This used to be the old coach-road before the railway was
opened, and many a coach has been stopped and robbed by gangs of
escaped convicts called bushrangers.&nbsp; People were easily
frightened in those days.&nbsp; A woman coming out of a cottage
at night has been known to stop a coach, and snapping the spring
of an old candlestick has ordered the passengers to &ldquo;bail
up&rdquo; and to throw the mail-bags out, which being done under
terror of the supposed pistol, she commanded them to drive on;
the coachman of course supposing there was a gang of ruffians
lying in wait.</p>
<p>Bushrangers are not yet a thing of the past, for while we were
in Sydney four were sentenced to death for the murder of a
policeman, who was one of a party sent in pursuit of the
gang.</p>
<p>Hard by our hotel is a solitary graveyard, where lie the
bodies of many convicts who died while confined in a neighbouring
stockade in the old transportation days.&nbsp; A more desolate
and melancholy place it would be impossible to imagine.&nbsp;
Some of the public-houses have queer mottoes on their sign
boards.&nbsp; We observed three not far apart having these
inscriptions: &ldquo;Labour in Vain,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Leisure
Hour,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Rag and Famish.&rdquo;&nbsp; A favourite
drink amongst the people is sarsaparilla, which is generally
mentioned on the sign along with the beer.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>There
are two kinds of birds in the woods about Mount Victoria which
make a great noise at night; one is called the &ldquo;Great Goat
Sucker,&rdquo; and continually cries &ldquo;more pork, more
pork&rdquo;; while the other, called the &ldquo;Laughing
Jackass,&rdquo; or the great kingfisher, makes night hideous by
its insane laughter; in the day-time, however, it performs a very
useful service, in waging perpetual war against the snakes.</p>

<p>The ants in Australia are rather formidable creatures.&nbsp;
Some of them are more than an inch in length, and one kind,
called the &ldquo;bull-dog,&rdquo; is very fierce, and will
attack anything; he can run backwards or forwards with equal
facility, and never turns his back to the foe.&nbsp; <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Their hills
are very large, and a slight tap brings numbers of them out at
once, and unless you want to be well punished, you had better
leave them quickly, for their bite is something to be
remembered.&nbsp; One morning while on a walk we observed two
boys &ldquo;prodding&rdquo; an ant-hill; but by the time we had
come up to them we found them otherwise engaged, for the
&ldquo;bulldogs&rdquo; had got up their clothes and were causing
the boys to jump about as though they were
&ldquo;possessed;&rdquo; occasionally they would pause and rub
their legs with great devotion; and altogether it was apparent
they felt their position keenly.&nbsp; As we passed them they
gave us a ghastly smile, and I think they will let
&ldquo;sleeping bull-dogs lie&rdquo; in the future.</p>

one of my visits to Sydney the political situation was
this:&mdash;Two questions were before the Parliament and
country&mdash;viz., an Amended Education Act, and an Excise Act,
by which latter it was proposed to put a tax upon colonial
beer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happens that a vacancy has occurred in an important
constituency, and as these questions are greatly agitating the
whole country, the election is looked forward to with great
interest as being a sort of test of the public sentiment.&nbsp;
The Government candidate of course supports the two measures
above referred to, while the opposition candidate is adverse to
both, the latter being the largest brewer in the Colony, (which
of course accounts for his opposing the excise duty on beer) and,
what is not unusual in the case of brewers, he is a decided
Churchman, and supporter of what he calls &lsquo;religious
education.&rsquo;&nbsp; The whole strength of the clergy,
publicans, bishops, loafers, avowed atheists, Roman Catholic
archbishop, priests, and Irish is most heartily with the
Church-loving, beer-brewing candidate, who is socially much
liked, and very strong.&nbsp; His opponent is supported by the
whole Liberal party, by large numbers of the Churchmen, and by a
few Catholics.&nbsp; The Amended Education Act simply provides
that whereas at present State aid is given to denominational
schools it shall now be withdrawn.&nbsp; The Bible is not read in
the schools, but the lesson books of the Irish National Schools
are used.&nbsp; Facilities are offered to the various
denominations to give religious instruction to the children in
the State schools.&nbsp; The bishop and clergy of the Church of
England and the Roman Catholic priests unite heartily with the
beer <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>interest (as usual), the proposal to tax the beer coming
in very opportunely to enlist the sympathies and votes of the
idle, drunken, venal, and dissolute portion of the
community.&nbsp; The bishop takes an opportunity of stating
publicly how much he is in favour of temperance, and his clergy
follow suit; the Catholic clergy do the same, and in the evenings
clergy of both religious denominations appear at public meetings
in support of the brewer!&nbsp; The publicans and their followers
are relieved from saying anything about the tax on beer by the
existence of the education question, which they heartily oppose,
thus avoiding the subject in which they have a selfish interest;
so it comes to this&mdash;Bible says to beer, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
support you, although it is rather inconvenient, for am I not
pledged to temperance?&rsquo;&nbsp; Beer says to Bible,
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll support you with all the strength of my lungs,
rendered all the noisier by copious draughts of untaxed beer;
beer and Bible, Bible and beer for ever!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Roman Catholic clergy anathematise Protestants of
all kinds and classes, including the Church of England, but the
latter joins hands with the Roman Catholics and the beer party to
gain its ends, the said ends being the same with both
Churches&mdash;viz., the triumph of priestly rule and
domination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer of the constituency, applauded throughout the
length and breadth of the land, was to return the Liberal
candidate by a majority of two to one.</p>
<p>In reference to this election the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i>
said&mdash;&ldquo;Many of the advocates for the extension and
maintenance of the denominational schools lay great stress upon
the doctrine that it is not just to deny denominational schools
to those who <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>prefer them&mdash;that if any citizen pays the education
tax he ought to have the sort of education provided for his child
that he most desires, and that it is a wrong-doing to his
conscience if this claim is not regarded.&nbsp; It is certainly
somewhat singular that the few advocates of this line of argument
are to be found in the ranks of the two great churches, which,
having been national churches, have, to say the least, not
distinguished themselves by defending the rights of
conscience.&nbsp; In England the march of religious liberty has
done much to undo Church-inspired legislation against those
outside the pale of the Church; and that being achieved it sounds
strangely to hear the &lsquo;conscience&rsquo; argument against a
uniform treatment of all citizens proceed from a quarter which
has not been the home of the rights of conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before leaving Sydney it may be well to describe an overland
ride I made from Sydney to Melbourne <i>vi&acirc;</i> Wagga Wagga
and Albury, at a time previous to the completion of the through
railway.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Leaving
Sydney by the Pullman train at six in the evening, Wagga Wagga is
reached about ten next morning: During the night we ascended
2,200ft.&nbsp; A large extent of the country is cleared, and,
being New Year&rsquo;s Day, it was rather strange to our English
eyes to see the wheat cut and stacked, and harvesting operations
going on.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The country through which our track passes is famous for its
sheep runs and for the high quality of the wool produced in
it.&nbsp; Here and there in the bush are occasional
labourers&rsquo; cottages, wretched, uncomfortable looking
buildings, constructed of rough planks covered with bark.&nbsp;
The children we saw had a very uncared-for look.</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Wagga
Wagga (pronounced Wogga Wogga) covers a large extent of ground,
but at present the number of houses is few, most of them,
however, being well built.&nbsp; From this place we hired a buggy
and pair of horses to take us to Albury, a distance of some
seventy to eighty miles, the charge for which, including the
services of a smart, bright boy as driver, was &pound;7.&nbsp;
Immediately on leaving Wagga we got into the &ldquo;bush&rdquo;
country, and during the afternoon passed some large stock
&ldquo;stations.&rdquo;&nbsp; The land appears to be much more
fertile than in the neighbourhood of Sydney, with greater depth
of soil.&nbsp; We put up for the night at Jerra Jerra, a place
consisting of two or three wood shanties, one of them being the
hotel, and left at 6.30 next morning, taking breakfast at a
somewhat larger group of wood huts called Germanton.&nbsp; Every
driver through the &ldquo;bush&rdquo; makes his own track among
the trees, and ours was no exception to the rule; he made long
detours at intervals, only coming out into the regular road when
a creek had to be crossed.&nbsp; We saw many pairs of large
magpies, and some other birds which the driver informed us build
large mud nests.&nbsp; Then the Great Ants, too, are very
numerous, so that one dare not sit down anywhere to rest.&nbsp;
The flies are also a great pest, and as my companion said,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t take a hint,&rdquo; requiring to be toppled
over before they will move.&nbsp; At about seven a.m. we passed
the Royal Mail bowling along amongst the trees, our driver
quickly making a fresh track to avoid the fearful dust which it
raised.&nbsp; The coach is a big lumbering machine, painted
flaring red, and drawn by six horses.&nbsp; It is licensed to
carry sixty-five passengers, who can <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>only be got on to it by being packed
like herrings in a barrel.&nbsp; The weather being so hot and the
dust so great, it must be terrible to be cooped up in it with fat
people and thin smokers and others.&nbsp; The coaches are hung
upon enormous leather &ldquo;springs,&rdquo; and they need them,
for the road is so rough, and the coachmen are so daring, that
the bumping and thumping are terrific.&nbsp; Each coach is fitted
with four large reflector lamps, three in front and one
behind.</p>
<p>While baiting the horses I had a chat with a farm labourer,
who, like a great many of the immigrants with whom I have spoken,
was sighing for old England again.&nbsp; He told me the ordinary
farm labourer&rsquo;s wages here are 12s. to 15s. a week with
board, and that 20s. a week is considered exceptionally good,
while the great heat, dust, and reptiles are so troublesome that
most of the labourers wish they were well out of it.&nbsp; This
man told me his little terrier was killed by a snake a day or two
before; the poor creature swelled up and died in great agony in
ten minutes after being bitten; its death, however, was speedily
avenged, his master killing the snake shortly afterwards.&nbsp;
The landlady said she was in great terror of the snakes, which
were very numerous.&nbsp; Near the run was a large log, and it
was well known that a big black snake had taken up his abode
there, for he was frequently seen to come out.&nbsp; In the
winter season the reptile would very soon have been despatched by
the same process adopted by the Chinaman when he wanted
&ldquo;roast pig,&rdquo; but this being summer, to fire the log
meant to cause a general conflagration in the bush.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>The
power of endurance of Australian post-horses is something
wonderful; yesterday we travelled more than thirty-five miles
after one o&rsquo;clock, over a rough bush road, or rather no
road at all, bumping up and down in a way that must be very
trying to the poor animals, as the &ldquo;path&rdquo; is never
certain; and to-day we had to go nearly fifty miles more, the
heat being intense, and the track covered with dust nearly a foot
thick.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Our driver, a mere lad of thirteen years, drove on with the
greatest confidence, never having missed the way once, though
there were no direction posts, and we did not come across a
person or house once in ten miles, and were amongst the trees all
the time.&nbsp; Towards evening the horses got rather tired, and
so did poor &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; the driver, who at times had a
quiet &ldquo;weep&rdquo; to himself, but at last we reached
Albury, and found our Melbourne friend awaiting us at the
hotel.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>For
hours before, we had in view a fine range of hills, enclosing a
large extent of country, including the valley along which the
River Murray runs.&nbsp; Here we got the blue, purple, and
roseate tints on the mountains to perfection, and as the sun was
going down just as we entered the town I thought I had rarely
seen a more delightful picture.</p>
<p>There is a thriving, well-to-do look about the place which is
very enlivening, the houses being well built, with wide verandahs
projecting from two storeys, the streets straight and wide, and
planted on both sides with acacias, poplars, and several
varieties of pines, the whole forming a veritable little
paradise.</p>
<p>This being the great centre of the wine-growing industry we
were desirous of visiting the vineyards and seeing the capacious
cellars which are formed in the hills, and for which the district
is somewhat celebrated, but our friend, being very anxious to get
back to Melbourne, assured us there was &ldquo;nothing to see
here,&rdquo; and told us to wait till we got into Victoria, and
so hurried us off.</p>
<p>We left Albury at 5.30 on the following morning, driving
across the Murray to the railway station at Wodonga, the first
town on the Victorian side, as Albury is the last on the New
South Wales side, and the contrast between the two is great
indeed&mdash;just the difference between prosperity and
decay.&nbsp; New South Wales, with its Free Trade policy, is
fitly represented by bright and shining Albury, while Victoria
may well read a lesson from the decay and ruin into which Wodonga
has fallen.&nbsp; I could not help thinking that a dozen such
contrasts along the frontiers of the two States would do <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>more than
anything to settle the fate of Protection.&nbsp; Even the omnibus
driver was full of the subject, pointing out to us as we rode
along the difference between the two places.</p>
<p>The railway ride to Melbourne occupies eight hours, although
the distance is only about 180 miles.&nbsp; On the way we passed
through Euroa, the town which was &ldquo;stuck up,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, plundered, by the notorious Kelly and his
gang.&nbsp; There were only four of these fellows in the gang,
but such was the terror they inspired that they were able to rob
a whole town in broad daylight, while a train was passing through
the station close by the bank from which they took a considerable
amount of cash.&nbsp; Having done this, they next ordered all the
people into carts, and drove them some miles out of the town,
ordering them not to stir for four hours under pain of
death.&nbsp; Having secured their booty the scoundrels rode off,
and for two years succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the
police, although the Government offered a reward of &pound;8,000
for their capture, alive or dead.</p>
<h2><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>Before leaving the subject of the Australian Colonies a few
observations on the state of the labour market, and upon the
social condition of the people, may be interesting.</p>
<p>In most of the Australian colonies Free Trade practically
prevails, the exception being Victoria.&nbsp; In this colony the
system of Protection is to be found in its most pronounced form,
almost every imported article of manufacture being the subject of
a heavy duty.</p>
<p>The avowed object of this system is to encourage immigration
by offering a premium upon the manufacture of every article in
considerable demand in the Colony.&nbsp; I do not know how far
this object has been attained as concerns immigration, but it is
an admitted fact, and one which is causing Victorian politicians
much anxiety, that the colony fails to retain its
population.&nbsp; One result about which there can be no question
is that this fiscal policy is concentrating the population about
the large towns, the city of Melbourne presenting the appearance
of the chief town of an old and populous State.&nbsp; A ride in
any direction into the country, however, soon discloses the real
nakedness of the land as regards inhabitants, the fact being that
a <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>very
small proportion of the immigrants ever get beyond the
towns.&nbsp; An obvious consequence is that the natural resources
of the country are greatly neglected, and the evil of this state
of things will be apprehended when it is seen that the
manufacturing population is increasing in a vastly greater ratio
than the constituency upon which its trade depends.&nbsp; Under
such conditions the dangers of the situation are seriously
augmented when depression of trade occurs.&nbsp; Such a state of
things arose before the building of the late Exhibition in
Melbourne.&nbsp; The building trade and the mechanical industries
in the city being in a stagnant state, large numbers of people
found themselves out of employment, their attitude causing the
Government some anxiety.&nbsp; The Exhibition was decided upon in
the hope that its erection would provide employment until trade
should revive.&nbsp; I asked one of the Commissioners of the
Exhibition what would happen if trade did not revive on the
completion of the building?&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;Oh, they
shall take it down again, for it will be useless after the
Exhibition is over.&rdquo;&nbsp; Surely a notable instance of the
dog subsisting by eating its own tail.</p>
<p>A natural result of all this is to produce in the minds of the
working classes a feeling that the Legislature ought to secure to
them a constant supply of work at high rates of wages, altogether
leaving out of consideration the inevitable effect of such a
course in checking demand.&nbsp; Naturally, each class expects to
receive the benefit of this policy, and it is not surprising that
the example of the manufacturers in demanding Protection should
be followed, and even bettered, by the working men.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>A
curious example of this occurred when I was in Australia.&nbsp;
The streets of Melbourne, being very wide and long, are
peculiarly well adapted for the introduction of tramways.&nbsp; A
Bill was introduced into the House authorising the construction
of an experimental line, but it had to be abandoned in
consequence of the determined opposition of the cab drivers, the
majority of whom own the vehicles which they drive.&nbsp; These
men argued, naturally enough, that as manufacturing trades were
protected against foreigners, their business also should be
protected against competition in the only form in which it could
arise.&nbsp; Doubtless this resistance will eventually be
overcome, but not without leaving a sense of injustice.</p>
<p>While each class seeks to have the benefit of Protection for
its own manufactures, it also seeks to obtain the benefits of
Free Trade for the raw material and smaller accessories used in
their production.&nbsp; At the time I am referring to, a Tariff
Revision Commission was in session, and representatives of the
various manufacturing trades were examined with the view of
ascertaining whether any changes were desirable.&nbsp; In almost
every case extensive additions to the duty were demanded,
eliciting from some of the members of the Commission a reminder
that on previous occasions the representatives of protected
industries declared they only required the tax to be levied for a
limited time in order to enable them to establish their
business.</p>
<p>The Protectionist newspapers used every means to stir up the
various trades to avail themselves of the opportunity the
Commission afforded of making fresh claims.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>It so
happens that most of the materials used for newspaper printing
are admitted duty free.&nbsp; The <i>Argus</i>, the leading
journal in Victoria, and a consistent advocate of Free Trade,
took this opportunity of suggesting that the proprietors of the
Protectionist journals should prove the sincerity of their
expressed opinions by appearing before the Commission and
demanding the imposition of a tax upon newspaper materials in the
interests of &ldquo;native industry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course the
suggestion was not adopted, perhaps for this reason, also
suggested by the <i>Argus</i>, that the struggle for existence
was already sufficiently severe.</p>
<p>The operative printers also demanded of the Commission that
printed books should be more heavily taxed, one of their
delegates remarking that &ldquo;there was sufficient talent in
Victoria to produce their own books,&rdquo; while a manufacturer,
with great candour, asked for a little increase upon his special
productions on the plea that his profit was not &ldquo;quite
enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If profits are not enough prices are certainly sufficiently
high, as the following instance will abundantly show.&nbsp; At
the close of 1882 one hundred locomotives were required by the
Government of Victoria, and although the needs of the country
were most urgent&mdash;complaints of the inefficiency of the
service coming in from all sides&mdash;the Protectionist party in
the House demanded that the whole number should be made in the
Colony, although there was only one firm who could undertake
their manufacture, and that firm was unable to deliver the first
engine under a period of ten months, and in addition to this, the
total price demanded for the contract was &pound;66,000 more than
the <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>engines could have been procured for without delay in
England.&nbsp; It is admitted that the locomotives made in the
Colony are much inferior to those imported, while in addition to
the excess in first cost, the expense of maintaining the colonial
engines is vastly greater.&nbsp; I was assured by competent
authorities on the railways that the colonial engines are
frequently under repair, and that their life is much shorter than
that of their English rivals.&nbsp; The same evil principle is
applied to the purchase of the miscellaneous stores supplied to
the railways, thereby greatly enhancing the cost of
working.&nbsp; Instances might be multiplied of the mischievous
effects of a vicious fiscal policy in a young and undeveloped
Colony.&nbsp; It is notorious that the great want of the Colonies
is a larger population, and the Government in various
ways&mdash;notably by making grants in aid of
immigration&mdash;offer inducements to bring this result
about.&nbsp; The manufacturers also require a larger field for
their productions; but the working-class element is jealous of
this very increase lest it should subject labour to competition,
unmindful of the fact that there is ample room for an infinitely
larger population.</p>
<p>Neither the agricultural nor the mining industries of the
Colony are protected.&nbsp; As regards the former, public opinion
would not permit the taxation of food; whilst, in the latter
case, the minerals raised are, for the most part, exported, there
being scarcely any demand for them in the Colony.&nbsp; But,
while these industries receive no benefit from the fiscal policy
of the Colony, they are heavily taxed in support of the revenue,
for not only are all the machinery and materials used in their
development subject to more than <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>25 per cent. import duty, but the
cost of labour is greatly enhanced by the high wages, which
become necessary when the purchasing power of money is diminished
by Protection.&nbsp; Every year witnesses a considerable
expansion of the industries in question; and every year the cry
becomes louder against the injustice and inequality of a system
which places the natural resources of the country under so great
a disadvantage.&nbsp; In consequence of the urgency of these
complaints there is now some prospect of a reduction of the duty
on agricultural and mining machinery.</p>
<p>I have met with men who were always ready to descant upon the
advantages of Protection, but who, almost in the same breath,
have told me they have never hesitated to evade the laws when
they could do so to advantage, or even to break them when it
suited their convenience and they could do so without much risk,
justifying their conduct by saying that it was &ldquo;quite right
to cheat the Government when they could, because the Government
were always ready to cheat them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In order to
circumvent the practices of such men as these, the Legislature
has been compelled to institute a complicated system of accounts
in connection with the importation of goods, harassing in the
last degree to those who have been accustomed to do business in a
country where trade is unshackled.</p>
<p>In spite of the boasted advantages of Protection, it is
evident that some manufacturers are not happy under it, as is
shown by the fact of my having some time ago received from an
important manufacturing firm in Victoria an application for my
business agency in the Colony.&nbsp; In their application, the
firm stated that the <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>workpeople in the Colony were so
very independent and so uncertain that they (the firm in
question) would rather at any time sell imported articles at a
smaller profit than manufacture them in their own works.</p>
<p>I have stated that the avowed objects of Protection were the
attraction of a larger population and the fostering of
&ldquo;native industry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, with these very objects
in view, the public men of New South Wales have from the first
adopted and persisted in a policy diametrically opposed to that
which has for years past been in force in the neighbouring Colony
of Victoria.&nbsp; If the principles of Protection be sound, we
should expect to find in the Free Trade Colony of New South Wales
a state of things even much worse than I have shown to exist in
Victoria.&nbsp; But what do we find?&nbsp; A constantly
increasing population; abundance of employment; a vast and
continually expanding railway system; shipping considerably
greater than that of the Port of London one hundred years ago; an
import and export trade greater than that of Great Britain at the
same period; in short, every evidence of great and enduring
prosperity.</p>
<p>As in America, &ldquo;where acres are many and men are
few,&rdquo; the manufacture of agricultural machinery has been
brought to greater perfection than in almost any other country,
so in Australia the same conditions have developed a flourishing
manufacture of special machinery used in mining&mdash;one of the
staple industries of the country.&nbsp; A demand for this
improved machinery has recently sprung up in other countries, a
considerable order having been received from India by an
Australian firm while I was there.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>In
Sydney&mdash;not in spite of, but because of, Free
Trade&mdash;the largest manufacturing concern in the Australian
Colonies has grown up.&nbsp; The founders of this large business
had the sagacity at the outset to recognise that there were
certain articles which must of necessity be better and more
cheaply made in the Colony than they could be imported.&nbsp;
They put down steam saw-mills for supplying planking, which
before had been imported; they next proceeded to make such
articles as window-sashes, doors, frames, etc., for
house-building, choosing such as could be manufactured almost
entirely by machinery, which they obtained from England and
America.&nbsp; By such natural means, and altogether free from
legislative interference, they have built up the enormous
business known as Hudson Brothers, Limited, railway rolling-stock
manufacturers.&nbsp; It is clear that with the most improved
machinery, purchased in the cheapest markets and imported duty
free, and having inexhaustible supplies of native timber, not
only cheaper but much better adapted to the climate than that
hitherto imported, the opening for a perfectly legitimate
business presented itself; in fact, they created a genuine
&ldquo;native industry.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Messrs. Hudson,
recognising, as already pointed out, that other countries have
also special advantages for the production of certain articles,
wisely abstain from attempting a hopeless competition.&nbsp; For
this reason they import such portions of the rolling-stock as
wheels, axles, springs, carriage-furniture, etc.</p>
<p>The free importation of mining and agricultural machinery into
New South Wales has given these industries such a stimulus that
they have been more <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>generally developed throughout that
Colony than those of Victoria, causing a continuous and
increasing demand for labour.&nbsp; The immigration into New
South Wales is greatly in excess of that into Victoria; and, in
addition to this, large numbers of artisans and others are
continually crossing the border from the latter into the former
Colony.&nbsp; In 1880, forty-five thousand persons arrived in New
South Wales from other than Australian ports, and it is not too
much to say that there is ample room for four times their number
every year.</p>
<p>Until a few years since the great shipping companies had their
repairing yards and shops in Victoria, but the extremely high
cost of everything required by them compelled them at last to
remove their establishments to her Free Trade neighbour, thereby
effecting a very considerable saving.&nbsp; The same causes have
doubtless been influential in securing to New South Wales the
remarkable development of its shipping interests during the last
generation.</p>
<p>So little is known in England of what our friends in the
Colonies are doing, that probably many will be startled to learn
that whereas in 1782 the total imports and exports of Great
Britain amounted in value to about &pound;23,850,000, in New
South Wales, in 1881, the value was &pound;27,650,000.</p>
<p>During the last thirty years the shipping annually arriving in
Sydney has increased from 90 vessels, with a tonnage of 48,776,
to 1,389 vessels, with a tonnage of 973,425; and the clearances
in the same period increased from 47 vessels, with a tonnage of
24,081, to 1,322 vessels, with a tonnage of 941,895.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>During the last ten years, too, the population of New
South Wales has increased 53 per cent., while that of Victoria
has only increased 18 per cent., and while the excess of
immigration over emigration in the former Colony has quadrupled,
it has been almost stationary in the latter.</p>
<p>During the same period the Customs revenue in Victoria,
notwithstanding the high tariff, has remained almost stationary;
while in New South Wales, with a low tariff and smaller
population, it has increased nearly one-half.&nbsp; The imports,
too, have increased 80 per cent., against 17 per cent. in
Victoria, and the exports 94 per cent. against 28 per cent.</p>
<p>These figures, taken from official papers in 1882, have never
been dealt with by Victorian Protectionists, but are full of
meaning to all those whom vested interests have not made
blind.&nbsp; While it is true that Australia presents, and will
continue to present, a great field for the surplus population of
older countries, it is, in my opinion, a mistake to suppose that
the upper grades of English artisans improve their position much
by going there.&nbsp; Wages are higher it is true, and eight
hours make up a day&rsquo;s work; animal food also is cheaper,
but almost everything else is dearer than in
England&mdash;house-rents, indeed, enormously so.&nbsp; An
artisan who in Birmingham would be well housed for 5s. to 6s. a
week would have to pay &pound;1 for much inferior accommodation;
this remark applies generally in Australia, the principal cause
being the great lack of artisans in the building trade.&nbsp;
Many too, may consider the higher wages and shorter hours of
labour as not too great a compensation for the exhaustion induced
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>by the
heat and dust of the climate and the annoyance from insect
life.&nbsp; But for unskilled labour and for skilled agricultural
labour there can be only one opinion,&mdash;viz., that the
Colonies present a field where sobriety and industry are certain
to bring a reward such as is altogether unattainable at home.</p>
<p>The education of the people is admirably provided for by the
Legislature, every district being well supplied with first-rate
schools, while the means of intercommunication by rail, post, and
telegraph are superior to those of any country in the world, when
the smallness of the population and the immense distances to be
covered are taken into consideration.</p>
<p>In Australia, especially in the southern Colonies, there is
happily no native question to absorb the attention of the people
and to upset the calculations of financiers, consequently the
colonists are able to devote all their energy to opening up the
natural resources of the country.&nbsp; At the present time many
millions of money are set aside for the construction of new
railways and for the supply and storage of water, and when these
are completed vast areas of agricultural land will be opened
sufficient to accommodate all the spare population of England for
many years to come.</p>
<p>If &ldquo;Young Australia,&rdquo; like his cousin in America,
has an unbounded confidence in the future of his country, he has
even more in himself, as is well illustrated by the following
story told me by an old resident.&nbsp; In one of the cities a
number of young men had established a Debating Society, which met
every Wednesday evening in a room in a narrow street.&nbsp; On
the other side of the street was a church where service was held
<a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>at the
same time.&nbsp; The weather being hot the windows of both
buildings were usually open, and the important deliberations of
the young men were much interrupted by the preaching and singing
in the church.&nbsp; With a delightful unconsciousness of what in
slang phrase is called &ldquo;cheek,&rdquo; they instructed their
secretary to write to the minister of the church, requesting him
to hold his service upon some other evening of the week!</p>
<p>The people of Australia are possessed of vast energy and great
intelligence: and, having unlimited and well-grounded faith in
their capacity to conquer the many difficulties which lie before
them, they determined that their future career shall do no
discredit to the great country from which they have sprung, and
of whose history they are so proud.</p>

113</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p>We left Sydney in the first week in April, and although we had
greatly enjoyed the beautiful scenery of its fine harbour and the
neighbouring Blue Mountains, and had experienced the greatest
kindness and hospitality on every side, we were not sorry to
depart.</p>
<p>In the first place, we were homeward-bound, and I had
recovered the health, in search of which I had left home and
friends, and the weather had been so oppressively hot and the
dust so troublesome, that we were glad of the prospect of the
abatement of the one and the total disappearance of the
other.</p>
<p>For ten months the Colony had had no rain, and in the
neighbourhood of Sydney trees were dying by hundreds, and gardens
which had been carefully tended for fifteen or twenty years were
nearly spoiled.&nbsp; The outlook for agriculturists was dark
indeed, very indifferent hay was selling for &pound;10 a ton, and
the cattle were perishing for want of water.&nbsp; I saw a
statement <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>in the paper that one farmer had already lost 45,000
sheep, and if the drought lasted a few weeks longer he would lose
50,000 more.&nbsp; The most inveterate grumbler at the moisture
of the English climate would, if here in Sydney, soon arrive at
the conclusion that six months&rsquo; rain is to be preferred to
ten months&rsquo; drought and dust under a scorching sun.</p>
<p>Some friends accompanied us on board our steamer, and
observing that the sky had become overcast with every prospect of
a heavy downpour, I endeavoured to persuade them to return to
shore, but they said the sky often looked overcast but soon
became clear again, and that there would be no rain; still I was
not comfortable, and presently induced them to go.&nbsp;
Half-an-hour afterwards our time was up, the ship&rsquo;s gun was
fired, and down came the rain in such torrents as made me very
apprehensive for the safety of my friends, lest their boat should
be swamped.&nbsp; On arriving at New York I found a letter from
them informing me that the rain filled the boat so fast that it
was with some difficulty they could keep it afloat.</p>
<p>Our vessel was an exceedingly fine one, and was on her first
voyage.&nbsp; Her length was 400ft. and she was 40ft. wide across
the saloon.&nbsp; The appointments seemed to be all very good,
although it soon appeared that she was insufficiently supplied
with stewards, the consequence being that the meals were badly
served.&nbsp; Everything, however, was done according to rule,
and it was curious to see the order in which the various dishes
were brought in.&nbsp; The chief steward rang a bell once, and
the stewards marched into the saloon in single file, dishes in
hand; two rings, right wheel; <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>three times, place dishes on the
table; and at the fourth ringing of the bell, remove covers and
march out with them.&nbsp; It looked like a pantomime, and caused
us considerable merriment.&nbsp; The head steward was a negro,
and it was curious to note how he lorded it over the white
stewards.</p>
<p>A rough passage of four days brought us to the entrance of
Auckland harbour.&nbsp; The previous day it was very stormy, and
an albatross which had been following us for some time,
frequently flying across the ship between the masts, at length
either flew, or was blown, against one of the masts, and fell
dead upon the deck.</p>
<p>In approaching the town of Auckland a number of islands of
curious shape, surmounted with rocks bearing the appearance of
castles are passed.&nbsp; Auckland looks well from the harbour,
which is a very fine one; behind the town a mountain rises to a
considerable altitude, greatly adding to the picturesqueness of
the view.</p>
<p>Our ship was the largest that had ever been in the harbour,
and we expected soon to have a number of boats plying for hire,
but none appeared until half our limited time had expired, and
consequently very few passengers went ashore.&nbsp; We took a
quantity of coal on board, the quality of which was very bad,
giving off volumes of the densest smoke.&nbsp; It is much
inferior to the New South Wales coal, which in its turn is not
equal to English.</p>
<p>For the first ten days the Pacific greatly belied its name,
being in a state of great commotion the whole time; indeed, most
of the way to San Francisco the roll was very considerable.&nbsp;
As we neared Kandavu, <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>in the Fiji Islands, the dreaded
coral reefs began to come in sight.&nbsp; Some of them stretch
out for fifteen miles from the land, and are known to approaching
vessels by the white crests of the long lines of breakers.&nbsp;
Navigation is very dangerous, and the harbour of Kandavu is a
very difficult one to make.&nbsp; Just before entering we passed
within fifty feet of the masts of a sunken ship; but, having
brought a native pilot from Sydney, we got inside safely.&nbsp;
The harbour is exceedingly beautiful.&nbsp; For some distance
from the water on each side the ground is covered with cocoa-nut
and bread-fruit trees, large ferns, and a great variety of bright
green foliage, while beyond is a range of hills of beautiful
shapes and well wooded.</p>
<p>It being Sunday only two or three boats made their appearance,
the missionaries not permitting the natives to come out to trade
or to gratify their curiosity on that day.&nbsp; Knowing this we
were not a little amazed to receive a visit presently from the
missionaries themselves, who were rowed by eight very intelligent
natives, having no clothing worthy of mention.&nbsp; Some of our
party taxed the missionaries with their lack of consistency, and
were answered that they came &ldquo;by invitation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The natives have fine open faces, with good foreheads, bright and
restless eyes.&nbsp; They are of a dark chocolate or liver
colour.&nbsp; Their hair is very abundant, but they spoil it by
putting quicklime upon it, turning it to a dirty reddish
brown.&nbsp; Their vivacity is astonishing.&nbsp; They laugh and
chatter in a ceaseless chorus, but their language is not
musical.&nbsp; One old fellow was particularly voluble; he was in
a boat, and was giving instructions <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>to his crew in a fearfully loud
voice, which sounded like the slipping of a ship&rsquo;s cable
through the hawser-hole.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It was great fun to watch the children diving for money.&nbsp;
If you threw a sixpence into the water they would go after it and
catch it before it had gone down many feet, quickly reappearing
to ask&mdash;like Oliver Twist&mdash;for more, and with a grin,
disclosing teeth which made us envy them.</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Some
of our fellow-passengers went ashore, and were much charmed with
all they saw.&nbsp; The little children very much delighted them
by coming up and putting their hands into those of their
visitors, leading them off to show them the bread-fruit and
banana trees.</p>
<p>Just as daylight was going our gun was fired, and with our
pilot on board we steamed out of the harbour, having the
pilot&rsquo;s boat in tow, manned with as merry a crew as ever
rowed a boat.&nbsp; The captain was very anxious to get clear of
the reefs before dusk, and so went at a pretty good speed, and
although the pilot-boat was half out of the water, and was
constantly being swamped, the crew laughed and shrieked with
delight, shouting and making curious noises like Christy
Minstrels.</p>
<p>Presently they commenced a song, one old fellow beating time
with an oar&mdash;but we preferred the shrieking.&nbsp; Soon the
pilot clambered down the ship&rsquo;s side, and after giving him
three cheers we set off at full speed.</p>
<p>There are many sharks in these waters, but it is said they are
not fond of the dark skins.&nbsp; Whether that is so or not I do
not know, but certainly both boys and men disregard the presence
of these monsters in diving for money.</p>
<p>The day after leaving Kandavu we passed through a beautiful
group of islands surrounded with coral reefs.&nbsp; We passed so
close to two of these islands that we were able to see the
cocoa-nut trees quite distinctly, the bright green vegetation
rising just above the pure white surf, and the whole surrounded
by the glorious purple and azure of the ocean.&nbsp; While
passing one of <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>the islands we saw a huge waterspout burst, and were
glad our ship was well out of it.</p>
<p>Soon after leaving the Fiji Islands the crew were put through
fire-brigade practice.&nbsp; The bell was rung continuously, the
whistles blown, and the crew and stewards rushed to the
fire-engines, and got out the buckets and hose, and soon began
playing over the ship, while the first officer superintended the
getting out and lowering of the boats.&nbsp; As very few persons
were warned of what was going to be done, there was naturally
great excitement amongst the passengers, one lady fainting in the
saloon, thinking the ship was really on fire.&nbsp; I was not
impressed with the smartness or efficiency of either officers or
crew, and was devoutly thankful that there was no need for their
services; and yet I often wondered there were no fires, there
being so many kerosene lamps all over the ship, to say nothing of
the immense kitchen fires, where twice in one morning I saw a
regular burst of flame through an unskilful cook overturning the
fat in the absence of his chief.</p>
<p>In going from England to Australia, and returning via the
Pacific, and across America, one day is gained, and in order to
keep our calendar right we had to &ldquo;drop a day,&rdquo; or
when we arrived at Liverpool we should be a day in advance of our
home friends.&nbsp; This is done by having two days of the same
name and date in one week.&nbsp; It appears rather curious but is
plain enough, for our general course since leaving home was
eastward, and continued so until we reached home.&nbsp; Now, as
in going east, four minutes to each degree are gained (the
reverse in going west), it <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>follows that in the 360 degrees into
which the earth&rsquo;s circumference is divided, a total gain of
360 &times; 4 = 1,440 minutes, or 24 hours is made.</p>
<p>Our doctor was somewhat of a curiosity.&nbsp; One evening he
told me that one of the passengers, who was suffering from an
ailment of the eyes, had declined his further services,
preferring to pay one of the passengers who was a medical
man.&nbsp; He assured me he had no feeling about it, he was quite
above that sort of thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our profession,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;is one in which we should always practice the virtue
of charity in accordance with the teaching of Christ, whose
follower I trust I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; But observing that during the
conversation he frequently swore, I gave him a hint about
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you remind me of my
little wife at home; whenever I swear or consign any one to a
warm place, she puts her finger up and says, &lsquo;Ah,
don&rsquo;t do that, you know you don&rsquo;t mean it,&rsquo;
which of course is perfectly true, so there is no harm in
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of our doctors was re-named a
&ldquo;compound-conceited-cuss-of-a-colonial-cockatoo-quack-of-a-doctor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He believed in the Australian &ldquo;spread eagle&rdquo;&mdash;in
the cockatoo, that is&mdash;and had visions of a time when
England would be a &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; country.&nbsp; But he
was labouring under the impression that there were eight millions
of people in the Australian colonies, whereas there were not more
than 2&frac12; millions of white, black, yellow, and brown.</p>
<p>Life on shipboard is not more free from little personal
difficulties than on land: one of our colonial friends daily
raised the susceptibilities of his neighbours at the dinner table
by emptying a favourite dish of fruit into his pocket for home
consumption; while just <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>before reaching Honolulu it was
rumoured there was to be a duel as soon as we arrived at the
island.&nbsp; One of the English travellers had an objectionable
habit of turning the fruit over with his fingers at dessert, and
picking out the best.&nbsp; A colonial gentleman frequently
rebuked him mildly for his breach of good manners, telling him he
should &ldquo;touch and take&rdquo;; and so it resulted in a
quarrel which it was said &ldquo;blood alone can
quell.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is satisfactory, however, to know that the
deadly encounter did not come off.</p>
<p>Being told by the Captain that we might expect to land at
Honolulu at 6 p.m., the four o&rsquo;clock dinner table was
comparatively deserted, most of the passengers preferring to
reserve themselves for what the Yankees call a &ldquo;good square
meal&rdquo; on shore.&nbsp; We arrived off the entrance to the
harbour in good time, and made the usual signals for a pilot, but
with no result.&nbsp; After sunset, guns and rockets were fired,
but no pilot appearing, the Captain decided to run in without
one.&nbsp; In consequence of the delay it was ten o&rsquo;clock
before we landed, when we found the islanders were <i>en
f&ecirc;te</i>, and were informed that on such occasions the
pilots decline to go out for vessels.&nbsp; Just as we were about
to land, one of our passengers, in the darkness, fell overboard,
but being a good swimmer and a strong, fearless man, he managed
to get aboard again, with no worse result than a wetting.&nbsp;
This gentleman had the reputation of being somewhat of a sceptic,
and that afternoon I had been discussing with him the subject of
a future state.&nbsp; When he was safe on deck again I reminded
him of our conversation, and asked what his thoughts were when
under the water in such a perilous situation.&nbsp; He replied,
&ldquo;I will tell you <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>exactly what I did think.&nbsp; When
I fell overboard I had three shillings in my hand, and my first
thought when under water was as to their safety; so, before doing
anything else, I safely deposited them in my pocket, and then
proceeded to &lsquo;go aloft.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; On landing we
found ourselves amongst a motley throng, whose faces, however,
were too dark to be seen, the majority dressed in light coloured
raiment, and all laughing, shouting, jabbering and shrieking in a
ten times more lively manner than a mob of gay Neapolitans on the
arrival of a train at Naples.&nbsp; We found the hotel about a
mile from the landing place, and very much enjoyed the walk along
the wide unpaved streets, lined with houses of various shapes and
sizes, many with gardens around them.&nbsp; Myriads of fire-flies
lit up the darkness, and the air was laden with the perfume of
tropical flowers.&nbsp; On arriving at the hotel, we found it to
be a spacious, well-lighted building, with lofty reception rooms,
through which we wandered in quest of waiters to whom to give our
orders for supper, but no servant could we find, neither could we
get any response to the bells, which were vigorously rung by a
hungry crowd.&nbsp; We made our way to the office, and were there
informed that we could get nothing to eat till next morning, as
the servants had &ldquo;gone home,&rdquo; and nothing was served
after nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; It was in vain we declared we
were starving; the only reply was that we could get what we liked
to <i>drink</i> at the bar.&nbsp; A Yankee standing by, pitying
our plight, said it was quite true we could get nothing that
night, but told us how we could be the first to be served in the
morning.&nbsp; He recommended us to order our breakfast at the
office <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>before leaving, and to pay for it there and then, and
to be at the hotel again before seven o&rsquo;clock next
morning.&nbsp; This we did, and then returned to the vessel,
where we also were too late to obtain anything to eat.&nbsp; In
the morning we were early at the hotel (buying some delicious
strawberries on the way), and proceeding to the breakfast room,
were informed we could not obtain admission until seven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At the appointed hour the folding doors were
opened by two natives of the &ldquo;Flowery Land,&rdquo; and we
were soon seated at the tables, which were crowded with a
bountiful supply of most tempting viands, and quantities of
luscious fruit.</p>
<p>As soon as all the seats were occupied the Celestial waiter
closed the door, and was most assiduous in seeing that his staff
attended carefully to the wants of his guests.&nbsp; Presently
there were loud knockings at the door, to which no attention
whatever was vouchsafed by the smiling Chinee; and when the
knockings were varied by angry exclamations from our friends
outside, his face became blander still.&nbsp; It could not be
said of this &ldquo;Heathen Chinee&rdquo; that his &ldquo;tricks
they were vain,&rdquo; for they were only too effectual in
keeping the hungry crowd at bay.&nbsp; When we had quite finished
(and I fear we were in no haste to depart), the doors were opened
to admit a further batch of impatient voyagers, and even then
only one half of the expectant throng could be admitted, the
remainder being advised to betake themselves to the restaurants
in the town.&nbsp; We shall not soon forget our experiences at
the Honolulu Hotel, the landlord of which is no less a personage
than His Most Gracious Majesty the King of the Hawaiian
Islands.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>We
occupied the remainder of the limited time at our disposal in
walking and driving around the town and neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The date and other palms, india-rubber and cocoanut trees,
tree ferns, guavas, and other kinds of tropical vegetation
flourish here in great abundance.&nbsp; Flowers of the most
brilliant colours grow everywhere, and the houses of the better
classes seem perfect little paradises, with numerous jets of
water flying.&nbsp; The grass is delightfully green and
beautiful, and great dragon-flies flit about in all
directions.&nbsp; Here and there we came across a group of little
black-eyed, brown-faced, merry children, looking shyly at the
white strangers, and rushing wildly along the streets.&nbsp; We
also met numbers of natives on horseback, dressed in splendid
colours&mdash;red, blue, yellow, and green&mdash;all mixed, or in
masses of one or more of these delicate hues.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
you ride,&rdquo; said one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;perhaps to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That no
good,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;for steamer sails
tomorrow!&rdquo; and off he went at a gallop.&nbsp; They are
sharp, sprightly fellows, very handsome, wonderfully lithe and
active, and have dark, flashing eyes.</p>
<p>The women of the labouring class are very stately looking, and
walk with a dignity and grace a duchess might envy.&nbsp; Their
clothing is not of a very extensive character, consisting
apparently of one long loose robe, gathered neatly around the
neck and wrists, with gay-coloured ribbons, and suggesting the
idea that seven years would be an unnecessary time for a Honolulu
girl to be bound to learn dressmaking.</p>
<p>Meeting a number of little girls returning from school, I
tried to get them to come and read to us <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>out of
their books.&nbsp; They were very shy, and it was some time
before they would venture near us.&nbsp; At last one of them let
me have her book, and I saw that her name was Emma&mdash;after
the good queen of that name, who visited England a few years
since&mdash;so I said, &ldquo;Now, Emma, read us something, and I
will give you this,&rdquo; holding a new threepenny piece before
her.&nbsp; At once she came and read a page in the true
conventional schoolgirl monotone.&nbsp; The book was printed in
Honolulu, and was in the native language, which sounded sweet,
and free from harshness.&nbsp; She was a nice-looking little
girl, quite a &ldquo;brownie,&rdquo; and was much pleased with
her threepenny-piece.&nbsp; The children were delighted at seeing
Queen Victoria&rsquo;s face on the coin, and frequently repeated
her name.&nbsp; The race is fast dying out, and in a few
generations will become extinct.</p>
<p>During the day we visited a school, and looked over the
Parliament House, which is a handsome building.&nbsp; The hall is
very large and lofty, and so also are the rooms, the walls and
ceilings being lined with a smooth white enamel.&nbsp; In
connection with the House of Parliament there is a tolerably good
library, and the nucleus of a good museum, but the country is
very poor; indeed I am told it is almost bankrupt.&nbsp; On
passing the post-office it occurred to us to ask if there were
any letters for us, although we did not expect any, and putting
our cards on the table we said we supposed there were no letters
for us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, but there are though,&rdquo; the clerk
said, &ldquo;and I am very glad to get rid of them,&rdquo;
whereupon, to our intense delight, he produced a huge packet of
letters and papers.</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>While
driving into the country we passed many pretty villas, with
gardens full of splendid shrubs and flowers, and on to a native
village.&nbsp; The houses are made chiefly of large rushes, which
grow here in great abundance.&nbsp; There seem to be no chairs or
seats in the houses, every one squatting on the ground.&nbsp; We
passed some native women carrying their babies, and I asked if
they would sell me one.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, for a dollar,&rdquo; <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>one
replied; but when I said &ldquo;Very well, then, bring it
here,&rdquo; she altered her mind, which was a good thing for me,
for I should not have known what to do with a black baby.</p>

<p>The temperature of Honolulu ranges between 60&deg; and
88&deg;, and the islands are always fanned by the N.E. trade
winds, rendering them exceedingly healthy.</p>
<p>Our visit conveyed the impression to our minds that it would
be impossible to spend a month more delightfully than among the
Hawaiian group, and we bade adieu to Honolulu with the greatest
regret.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful moonlight evening when we left Honolulu for
San Francisco, and after many months&rsquo; travelling by land
and sea, we began to feel that we were at last really homeward
bound, for would not our <i>next</i> voyage land us at
Liverpool?&nbsp; While at Honolulu we received a very
considerable addition to our passenger list in the persons of a
number of Americans, of both sexes, some of them being
gentlefolks and some of them not.&nbsp; We also took on board
three thousand bundles of bananas, which were hung up in the
netting all round the promenade deck.&nbsp; This was a most
unfair arrangement on the part of the captain, as not only were
the seats on this deck rendered unavailable, and a large portion
of the space occupied, but the ship became overrun with
centipedes, some of them five inches long, making it like Egypt
during one of the plagues, &ldquo;for they were in all our
quarters,&rdquo; in our beds and in our clothes.&nbsp; Americans,
as a rule, are not good sailors.&nbsp; Hence it is that when
commencing a voyage they take it for granted that they are going
to be ill, and make their arrangements accordingly.&nbsp; My
companions had <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>been flattering themselves that the spare berth in
their cabin would remain empty to the end of the voyage, but they
were doomed to disappointment, for it was their bad fortune to
receive one of the most bilious-looking of the new
arrivals.&nbsp; On entering the cabin the first observation the
Yankee made was, &ldquo;Where d&rsquo;ye throw up?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The answer to which was, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t &lsquo;throw
up&rsquo; at all.&nbsp; We <i>go</i> up and lean over the lee
side.&rdquo;&nbsp; The event proved the Yankee&rsquo;s
apprehensions to be well founded.&nbsp; One party of Americans
were returning from a prolonged residence on one of the islands
of the Pacific, where they appeared to have acquired some of the
native habits.&nbsp; One day these people were taking their lunch
on deck; it consisted of chicken and a native dish called
&ldquo;POI.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter was a substance like
bill-stickers&rsquo; paste, and was contained in a large
bowl.&nbsp; The company, which numbered some five or six persons,
men and women, sat upon the deck around the bowl, and, having
learned from their new acquaintances, the savages, to do without
spoons and separate dishes, helped themselves to the delicious
mixture by each dipping two fingers into the common bowl until it
was empty.&nbsp; They then attacked the chicken, and had
evidently taken lessons in carving from the same authorities, for
they adopted the primitive plan of pulling it to pieces.&nbsp; Of
course these proceedings excited considerable remark among the
passengers, but the party seemed quite insensible to
observation.</p>
<p>Another of our passengers was an American, named Steinberg,
who had a grievance against the British Government on account of
an alleged outrage on the part of an English man-of-war&rsquo;s
crew, in some dispute <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>in the Samoan Islands.&nbsp; He was
nursing his wrath until he arrived at Washington, when he
certainly thought England&rsquo;s fate would be settled, and that
she would be &ldquo;chawed up catawampously.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
man was accompanied by a Yankee journalist of a most anti-British
type.&nbsp; He was a sallow-faced man with a large square lower
jaw, without any hair on his face, and with straight lanky locks,
and, moreover, was something under five feet high.&nbsp; He was
so thorough-going in his hatred of everything British that when
&ldquo;God save the Queen&rdquo; was sung at the close of a
concert in the saloon, he got up with much fuss and stalked out,
followed by some half-dozen of his countrymen.&nbsp; We called
the fiery editor &ldquo;Jefferson Brick,&rdquo; after Martin
Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s acquaintance.&nbsp; On one occasion I heard a
friend of this gentleman ask him if he had a chair on deck.&nbsp;
He said he had not, as the Britishers always brought a good
supply.&nbsp; I took the hint, and determined that, at any rate,
he should not use mine.&nbsp; Soon afterwards it happened that a
sea, breaking over the deck, soaked the carpet seat of my chair,
which obliged me to place it in a sunny position that it might
dry.&nbsp; Presently I saw &ldquo;Mr. Brick&rdquo; deliberately
fetch the chair, which was a very comfortable one, and, taking it
into the shade, settle down on it.&nbsp; I went to him and
remarked that the chair was quite wet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess
it&rsquo;s dry now,&rdquo; said he, with the peculiar twang of a
down-east Yankee.&nbsp; Seeing that he failed to take the hint, I
told him that the chair was mine and that I would thank him to
give it up.&nbsp; This he did, with a remark that he &ldquo;did
not see what people who were always walking about wanted with
chairs at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>We
were not altogether without curious examples of our own
countrymen as fellow-passengers.&nbsp; One in particular, an
Irish tradesman, from one of the New Zealand ports, seemed
determined to amuse and be amused.&nbsp; We called our friend
&ldquo;Mister,&rdquo; because he addressed everybody by that
name.&nbsp; It appears that &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; was too fond of
liquor, and that he had to take an occasional holiday, in order
to give his friends an opportunity of putting his affairs
straight at home.&nbsp; I was told that he had a flourishing
business, which was managed by two able assistants, who insisted
upon his leaving them for twelve months in the interest of the
concern, under the penalty, if he returned, of their opening an
opposition shop.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; told me he had been
educated in four Colleges in Ireland, which, doubtless, accounted
for the remarkable absence of knowledge he displayed.&nbsp; He
frequently alarmed us by the disappearance of the knife down his
throat at the dinner table.&nbsp; One evening he volunteered to
read at one of the entertainments in the saloon, and caused great
amusement by the richness of his humour and of his
brogue&mdash;winding up his reading by the impromptu observation,
&ldquo;and shure it is oi that am moighty dray.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
shall hear of &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; again when we get to San
Francisco.</p>
<p>One of our passengers, who died during the voyage, had been
suffering greatly from severe pains in the head.&nbsp; He had
been told by a lady that sometimes great relief was obtained in
such cases by rubbing brandy upon the head.&nbsp; Soon after
giving this advice the lady was walking down the saloon where
there were a number of passengers and stewards, when she was
astonished by <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>hearing the poor invalid calling after her in the most
excited manner, and to the no small wonderment of the passengers,
&ldquo;Miss, Miss, did you say brandy or whiskey?&rdquo;&nbsp; On
one occasion the doctor was examining this patient, when the poor
fellow appealed to him to do what he could for him, saying,
&ldquo;Doctor, I should like to have one more chance, do you see,
and if you can put this old crazy machine together again and make
it run once more I shall take it&mdash;<i>as a personal
favour</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Before he became dangerously ill the
invalid was in the same cabin with one of my friends, who one
night was considerably disturbed by his dreadful coughing, varied
at intervals by strong language respecting the cough, which, he
declared, did not belong to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
mine, I never had a cough, it&rsquo;s my head that&rsquo;s
wrong&mdash;this cough belongs to some other fellow; what&rsquo;s
it bothering me for?&rdquo; and when some ladies gently
remonstrated with him he said, &ldquo;Look here, now, I guess
it&rsquo;s just as natural for me to swear as it is for you to
pray!&rdquo;&nbsp; His end came suddenly at last, and in a few
hours after, in the early morning, his remains were</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the deep bosom of the ocean
buried.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We sighted the entrance to the magnificent harbour of San
Francisco at daybreak on a beautiful morning at the end of April,
and when we approached it the sun had just risen, bathing the
whole scene in a flood of golden light, fully justifying its
name, &ldquo;The Golden Gate.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a short time the
city came in view, reminding me very forcibly of Sheffield, from
the dense masses of smoke which hung over a large portion of it,
for San Francisco is an important manufacturing place.&nbsp; Soon
we were boarded by a motley crew, composed of <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Custom
House officers, hotel-touts, porters, agents for the railway, and
a number of keen-eyed gentry, desirous of earning a cent anyway,
honest or otherwise.&nbsp; We had decided upon going to the
famous Palace Hotel, and having found the agent, placed our
luggage under his care, receiving checks for it, and, locking our
cabin, proceeded on shore, where we found the most sumptuous
omnibus we had ever seen waiting to convey passengers to the
hotel.</p>
<h2><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p>The Palace Hotel in San Francisco is quite a town in itself,
containing as it does over a thousand rooms, and with rarely less
than a thousand inhabitants, including servants, only a limited
number of the latter, however, living in the house.&nbsp; The
establishment has its own gas-works, four artesian wells,
affording an abundant supply of the purest water; it also
possesses a thoroughly good fire-brigade, and an efficient system
of police.&nbsp; There are five hydraulic lifts for the
conveyance of guests and luggage to each floor of the
house.&nbsp; The rooms on the ground floor are 25ft. high, and of
corresponding size, the breakfast room being 110ft. by 53ft., the
dining room 150ft. by 55ft., the walls being hung with excellent
copies of the best works of the great masters.&nbsp; The
corridors are lined and paved with white marble, and the grand
staircase is of the same material.</p>
<p>The bedrooms are very large and airy, and they all have
comfortable dressing-rooms attached, with hot and <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>cold water
supply, and with a dozen beautiful towels&mdash;a very refreshing
sight to the voyager who has been cooped up for the previous
month in the limited space allotted to passengers on an ocean
steamer.&nbsp; The bedrooms have baths adjoining them, each bath
being arranged for two rooms; there is also a service-room on
each landing, where a dusky negro is always in attendance.&nbsp;
Upon each landing there is a tube for the conveyance of letters
for the post direct into the letter-box at the general
office.&nbsp; There is also a pneumatic despatch-tube for the
conveyance of messages and parcels to and from any point on the
different floors.&nbsp; Upon the garden floor of the hotel there
is an arcade promenade 12ft. wide, with entrances to all the
shops under the hotel, upon the street level, each shop having a
show window upon this promenade.&nbsp; There are three inner
courts, the centre one being 140ft. by 84ft., covered with glass
of the same height as the roof of the hotel.&nbsp; It has a
carriage and promenade entrance from the street of 44ft. in
width, and a circular carriage way of 54ft. in diameter, which is
surrounded by a marble-tiled promenade and a tropical
garden.&nbsp; The garden is well supplied with exotic plants,
statuary, and fountains.&nbsp; Around this centre court and upon
every storey there is an open gallery from which all the bedrooms
are entered, and from which they receive light and fresh
air.&nbsp; The dining rooms are fitted with a large number of
small tables for parties of from four to eight persons, an
arrangement very much superior to the long tables in most
<i>salles &agrave; manger</i>.</p>
<p>There are about four hundred waiters, one-fourth only being
white men, the rest negroes.&nbsp; The latter <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>seem
specially adapted for waiting, being active and nimble, and
seeming to anticipate every wish.&nbsp; They receive &pound;1 per
week wages and their board, but lodge away from the house.&nbsp;
A fresh bill of fare is printed daily for each meal, and the
variety of food is very great, there being a choice of about
seventy dishes at dinner.&nbsp; In the kitchen are twenty-seven
French cooks, besides assistants&mdash;a sufficient guarantee for
the excellent manner in which the food is prepared.</p>
<p>There is a splendid laundry in the house, where the washing is
done by fifty Chinese washer<i>men</i>, and certainly never was
linen more exquisitely got up than here.&nbsp; These Celestials
are specially successful in all kinds of starching requiring a
smooth polished surface, such as shirt fronts.&nbsp; The mode in
which they apply the starch is quite novel, for having taken a
mouthful they blow it out on to the article in a continuous fine
spray, while their hands are occupied in ironing.</p>
<p>The servants take their meals in <i>table d&rsquo;hote</i>
fashion, being waited on by a batch of their fellow servants, and
everything is conducted with the greatest possible regularity and
order.&nbsp; I was much pleased to find that all the gas and
water fittings, also the hydraulic lifts and pumps, were supplied
by English makers, and were such as to command the admiration of
everybody.</p>
<p>An American gentleman, hearing me speak of the hotel, asked me
how I liked it?&nbsp; I told him I was greatly delighted with it;
that it was a palace, indeed, in all its arrangements, but that
in one respect I had been not a little astonished at what I had
seen there&mdash;the presence of the extreme of civilisation face
to face with a very close approach to barbarism.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
is <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>that,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I
replied, &ldquo;you are only supplied with one knife and fork at
meals; each guest has to dip his fishy knife into the butter, and
the same process has to be gone through in taking salt and
mustard; and seeing it is the fashion amongst the American guests
to put the knife into their mouths, the idea is not
pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I referred, too, to another peculiarity of the Americans
arising, I believe, from their extensive use of the Virginian
weed in chewing, and I said that the guests at the Palace Hotel,
in passing through its marble halls, had not the same excuse for
their conduct that the old Greek philosopher had when he was
being shown over the palace by Cr&oelig;sus, and when he excused
himself for an unparalleled act of rudeness by saying &ldquo;that
such was the magnificence on every hand that the face of the king
was the meanest thing that presented itself,&rdquo; for the
proprietor of the hotel had made the most ample provision for the
national habit&mdash;a provision which was, however, very
generally disregarded.</p>
<p>The city of San Francisco is exceedingly well situated, and
possesses many handsome streets, extensive hotels, and public
buildings, but in none of these respects, save only in hotels, is
it equal to Melbourne, though the evidences of great business
activity and prosperity are much greater in the former city.</p>
<p>The day after I arrived at the hotel I was surprised at
receiving the following letter:&mdash;&ldquo;Dear
Tangye,&mdash;Should you wish to see me I am to be found at the
above address, or a letter addressed to me, Box 339, Post Office,
will reach me promptly.&nbsp; My wife is dead.&nbsp; A. J. C.
Jarratt.&rdquo;&nbsp; The name was quite <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>strange to
me, so I decided <i>not</i> to go, but to send a friend.&nbsp; My
friend found the address, which was a wretched room at the top of
a lofty pile of buildings, and after a few minutes&rsquo;
conversation with the man he saw there, was very glad to get into
the street again, not liking the aspect of things.&nbsp; The
following day, whilst seated at dinner with my friends, a waiter
came to us and asked which was Dr. L&mdash;.&nbsp; On being told,
he said a messenger from the chief of police was in waiting,
wishing to see him.&nbsp; I looked at the doctor and asked him
what he had been doing.&nbsp; Having finished our dinner we
adjourned to the office and found the officer, who said his chief
had received a telegram from a man in some town a hundred miles
inland requesting him to send &ldquo;his friend the Doctor&rdquo;
up to him as soon as possible.&nbsp; Of course my friend, knowing
nothing whatever of the man, declined to go up country.&nbsp; I
mentioned these polite attentions to a gentleman who was dining
at the same table, and who I found was the leading lawyer in the
city.&nbsp; He told me it was a favourite dodge with the
sharpers, and that they sometimes caught a &ldquo;flat&rdquo; in
this way.&nbsp; On the arrival of ocean steamers it is the custom
to publish the names of the passengers in the evening papers,
which accounts for the familiarity of these fellows with the
names of strangers.&nbsp; We had many amusing chats with this
lawyer.&nbsp; He remarked one day that I must have met with a
deal of &ldquo;character&rdquo; in travelling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I had, both good and
bad.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wa-a-l, I guess its better to meet with
a <i>bad</i> character than none at all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Speaking of
the neighbouring State of Nevada, which was still in a very
unsettled condition, <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>he said a friend of his was Governor
there, and that he &ldquo;was 6ft. 6in. in height, and had a
number three head and a number fifteen foot, for,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I guess weight of foot is more important there than weight
of brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are sharp men of business in the city who do not require
offices in which to carry on their business.&nbsp; If you are
walking in the streets with a friend, and, meeting someone else,
stop for a chat, you will see a &rsquo;cute-looking fellow stop,
and though he appears to be intent on something on the opposite
side of the street, you will note that he is leaning his ear
towards you, doubtless with the laudable intention of gaining a
little information.&nbsp; On one occasion we met one of these
individuals.&nbsp; He kept his ear open, and then struck in with
&ldquo;I guess you are going through to England.&nbsp; I can put
you up to the best way of doing it and calculate I can save you
from forty to fifty dollars on the job.&rdquo;&nbsp; We say we
are much obliged, and will perhaps &ldquo;call
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then as you proceed along the streets
attenuated fellows, with scanty, pointed beards and Mother
Shipton hats, accost you with &ldquo;Going east, gentlemen?&nbsp;
Guess you&rsquo;ll want to change some money.&nbsp; Come with me,
gentlemen, and I&rsquo;ll take you to the right
place.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; we say, &ldquo;not
to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wa-a-l, guess exchange will go
against you to-morrow, gentlemen.&rdquo;&nbsp; Observing on the
door of a very handsome house a brass name-plate with the name
&ldquo;Mrs. Doctor Sanders,&rdquo; our guide informed us that
there were many lady doctors in the city, and that they had very
extensive practice.</p>
<p>The Chinese are very numerous in San Francisco, there being
more than 40,000 of them there.&nbsp; At the <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>time of my
visit, the feeling of the rowdies ran very high against the
Celestials, and threats of wholesale massacre were freely used
against them.&nbsp; John Chinaman is a most industrious, frugal
man, spending very little upon his living, and nothing upon his
pleasures, always excepting his infatuation for opium.&nbsp; His
needs being few, he can afford to work for very small pay, and
thus comes into competition with the white workman.&nbsp; This is
the head and front of his offending, but it is aggravated by the
fact of his being equally skilful as an artificer.&nbsp; While
the artisans have their special grievances about the Chinese, the
wealthy classes have theirs also.&nbsp; It is true
&ldquo;John&rdquo; does his master&rsquo;s work well and cheaply,
but, as I have said before, he is not a spending man; his sole
object is to get what the Yankees call &ldquo;his little
pile&rdquo; as quickly as possible, and then return to his native
land.&nbsp; Nor is this surprising when we consider that every
Chinaman leaves his little &ldquo;Min-ne&rdquo; behind him when
he quits the Flowery Land, it being a very rare thing for a woman
to leave China.</p>
<p>The Chinese quarter is full of interest; the people swarm like
bees, and live in a frightfully overcrowded state.&nbsp; The
butchers&rsquo; and barbers&rsquo; shops are the most numerous
and most interesting, the former being filled with a quantity of
dreadful-looking little portions of meat, but it would puzzle the
most learned to say from what animal they were cut.&nbsp; The
barbers&rsquo; shops are situated in the basements of the houses,
with an open front towards the street, and they are very
numerous, for the Chinese are close shavers.&nbsp; On looking
down you may see a number of men seated <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>in a
variety of positions, each one smoking a pipe of opium, while the
barber is occupied in shaving every portion of his head and face,
excepting, of course, his beloved pig-tail.&nbsp; The swell
Chinee is very particular that every hair shall be removed, and
so clever do the operators become that, by means of tiny razors,
they can shave the inside of the nose.&nbsp; Some of the
pig-tails are of enormous length, and sometimes the white rowdies
attack the Chinese and cut their pig-tails off.</p>

</a></p>
<p>When a man has an especially fine one, he either rolls it up
at the back of his head and fastens it with hairpins, or else
tucks it inside his blouse.&nbsp; I noticed one of the latter in
particular, a glimpse of which would have delighted Darwin
himself.&nbsp; The owner had evidently let down his back hair
before putting on his blouse, and consequently the pig-tail,
which disappeared at the back of the neck, emerged from under the
blouse and extended to his heels.</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Some
of our party, wishing to explore the Chinese quarter by night,
engaged a detective to accompany them, it being unsafe to go
unless so escorted.&nbsp; The guide first took them over a
lodging house, in which some hundred Chinamen were stowed away,
literally almost as thick as herrings in a barrel.&nbsp; Not only
was the floor thickly covered, but suspended above it was a layer
in hammocks, some smoking opium and others sleeping, none,
however, taking the slightest notice of the intruding party.</p>

<p>On visiting the Chinese theatre during the evening they found
preparations being made to celebrate a Celestial wedding.&nbsp;
This decided them to stay and see the ceremony, which was
attended by a vast number of Chinese, the theatre being crowded
in every part.&nbsp; After the ceremony most of the spectators
formed in the procession, which escorted the happy pair to their
home.&nbsp; My friends also visited the Joss Houses and inspected
the queer-looking gods contained in them.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>While
making some purchases in a Chinese shop it was necessary to give
my address.&nbsp; I wrote it out on a card thus&mdash;<span
class="GutSmall">TANG-YE</span>, upon which the Celestial at once
claimed me as a countryman of his.&nbsp; I disabused his mind of
that idea by putting my fingers to the outer corners of my eyes
and pretending to extend them in an upward direction, the absence
of which peculiarity showed conclusively that I was not of the
true Mongol type.&nbsp; Curiously, however, on afterwards
consulting a gazetteer, I found that there is in China a city
named <span class="GutSmall">TANG-Y</span>, containing over
30,000 inhabitants.</p>
<p>The Chinese are accused of having brought with them a number
of objectionable practices, but to anyone possessing a knowledge
of the lower classes in American cities, it will not appear
possible that the Chinese can be very much worse than they.</p>
<p>Most of the traffic in San Francisco is carried on by the
tramways, and it may not be out of place to put intending
visitors on their guard with respect to a little peculiarity in
their management.&nbsp; It is advisable to tender the exact fare
if possible, for if you give a larger sum the balance is returned
to you, not in cash, but in tickets available for future rides,
which you may have no opportunity of taking.&nbsp; The hackney
carriages are very fine, being almost equal to English private
carriages.&nbsp; Most of those I saw were splendidly horsed with
a pair of magnificent animals, generally black.&nbsp; The lowest
fare taken is ten shillings, but I am bound to say you can have
full value for your money in the time and the accommodation given
you.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning the city presents a very lively
aspect.&nbsp; The fire-brigades and volunteers parade the <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>streets,
preceded by their bands, and thousands of people go by tramway
and other vehicles to see the famous sea-lions at the entrance to
the bay.&nbsp; From the grounds in front of Cliff House they are
seen on the rocks below in large numbers, tumbling about and
making a noise like the barking of dogs, but so loud as to be
heard from a distance of nearly a mile.</p>
<p>The climate is a delightful one, the temperature being
singularly equable, ranging, as it does, in summer from 60&deg;
to 70&deg;, and in winter from 50&deg; to 60&deg; Fahr.&nbsp;
Indeed the weather is so beautiful that one cannot help referring
to it frequently, but the invariable reply to any such
observation is, &ldquo;Well, I guess we shall have three months
just the same right slick away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After nearly a fortnight&rsquo;s stay at the Palace Hotel,
enjoying its good fare, we began to think it time to move
eastward, as we were getting too luxurious in our habits.&nbsp;
My friend the lawyer, however, remarked that we need have no fear
on that account, as the fare on <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>the Pacific Railway would cure the
severest attack of gout.&nbsp; Before leaving San Francisco we
met our old friend &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; twice.&nbsp; From a
report in the newspapers we learnt that he had been brought
before the magistrates and fined for carrying fire-arms in the
streets.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; told us the police had taken
all his money on the pretence of taking care of it for him.&nbsp;
When we last saw him he was leaning against a lamp-post,
helplessly drunk.</p>

<p>The great excursion from San Francisco is of course to the
Yosemite Valley, but we were compelled to forego the pleasure of
making it on account of our visit being too early in the
season.&nbsp; Some of our fellow-voyagers from the Colonies
ventured to go, but, unfortunately, they met with a serious
carriage accident, owing to the roughness of the road, caused by
the breaking up of the frost.</p>
<p>In order to secure a good seat in the train going East, it is
necessary to make arrangements a few <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>days before starting.&nbsp; Tickets
can be obtained at a score of places in the city, and should be
got as soon as possible; and in order to save all unnecessary
trouble with the luggage during the journey, sufficient for use
in travelling should be separately packed, and the remainder
handed over to the Baggage Master, who has an office in the
hotel, and who will give checks in exchange, and undertake to
deliver it at any hotel or railway station in New York, or any
other place in the States that may be named.&nbsp; By attending
to this overnight, immense trouble is saved, for, if left until
the morning of departure, each traveller has to look after his
own baggage amid a scene of the wildest confusion, and quite
unprotected from the terrible heat and dust.&nbsp; It was with a
sense of great relief that we began to move out of the station,
and to feel that at last we were fairly started on our ride
across the Rocky Mountains.&nbsp; The railway ride for the first
two hundred and fifty miles is a splendid one, through the
magnificent Sacramento Valley, which I should think is fifteen or
twenty miles wide, and is most fertile.&nbsp; Here corn is grown
year after year without any manuring being required.&nbsp; In
many &ldquo;cuttings&rdquo; through which we passed the soil was
twenty feet deep.&nbsp; We passed fields hundreds of acres in
extent, with nice houses, orchards, and gardens, surrounded by
fine oaks and elms, making the country look like a park for a
hundred miles.&nbsp; The corn, which in many places was over ten
feet high, was fast ripening, and its glorious golden colour was
often charmingly varied by immense patches of Marigold,
Eschscholtzia, Lupins, and another beautiful flower which we did
not recognise, all in full bloom.&nbsp; We also <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>saw our old
Tasmanian friend the Eucalyptus (commonly called the Gum Tree),
and many of the quaint Dor&eacute;-like dead Blue Gums, looking
white and ghostly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p148.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>This is a magnificent State.&nbsp; A gentleman remarked to me
that when the richness of the soil is exhausted there remains
untold mineral wealth below.&nbsp; The people, too, are very
energetic, and there is abundance of capital; so much so that a
moneylender travelling in our carriage complained that it is
difficult to get fifteen per cent. per annum now when some twelve
years ago he could easily obtain five per cent. per month.</p>
<p>Soon after leaving Sacramento the track ascends the mountains
and passes through the old gold-diggings so much spoken of thirty
years ago.&nbsp; They are visible all around for miles, and some
are still being worked.&nbsp; <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>All the abandoned ones have been
re-worked by the Chinese, who have got a great deal out of
them.&nbsp; By and by we stopped at a station where there were
several dreadful-looking Indians, some with their faces covered
with red ochre and with feathers in their hair; others dressed in
scarlet blankets, tall white hats, one-legged trousers and
moccasins.&nbsp; They all looked very grave and stolid.&nbsp; I
did my best to make one old fellow laugh as he stood on the
platform with his arms folded, but his face was stony, and he
remained steadfast and unmoveable.&nbsp; Their hair is like
whalebone, matted and shaggy; their noses and mouths are broad,
and the women look uglier than the men.&nbsp; Several of the
women were carrying their <i>papooses</i> (babies) suspended over
their shoulders, with the legs swathed like Neapolitan
children.&nbsp; The only occupation of these degraded creatures
is begging and stealing.</p>
<p>While we were passing through swampy tract the large
bull-frogs were giving a croaking concert in full chorus, and a
rare noise they made.</p>
<p>Soon we began to sight the snow mountains, and by nine
o&rsquo;clock we were right amongst the pine forests and the
snow, and very beautiful the scene looked with the moon shining
on it all.</p>
<p>Life on board a &ldquo;Pullman&rdquo; train is almost more
peculiar than life on board ship.&nbsp; My party were fortunate
enough to secure a cabin partitioned off from the rest of the
carriage; but the remainder of the sleeping berths have no
partitions, being separated merely by curtains.&nbsp;
Inexperienced travellers are apt to forget this, and sometimes
cause much amusement in consequence.&nbsp; One morning I heard a
young lady <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>complaining to her mamma that she could not find her
stockings, a remark eliciting numerous offers of assistance from
all parts of the carriage.&nbsp; A neighbouring compartment was
occupied by a lady and gentleman, the former of whom was deaf,
and with the peculiarity often observable in deaf people, she
imagined everyone else was deaf as well; the consequence being
that there were no secrets in that cabin.&nbsp; Every carriage
has a negro attendant, whose duty it is to make the beds and
attend to the lavatories, the ladies&rsquo; and gentlemen&rsquo;s
lavatories being at opposite ends of the carriage.&nbsp; At
half-past nine o&rsquo;clock Sambo begins to prepare the beds,
and soon after ten almost everyone has retired, and, as
fortunately there are no decks to be paced, sleep soon comes to
the weary.&nbsp; Arrangements are made for three meals a day, the
train stopping at stations convenient for the purpose, and notice
being given half-an-hour before.&nbsp; Half-an-hour is allowed
for each meal, the invariable charge being one dollar.&nbsp; As
the train stops a general stampede is made toward the
dining-room, the position of which is unmistakable, for at the
door stands a negro, with a face devoid of expression, vigorously
sounding a gong.&nbsp; As each person passes in he pays his
dollar, and makes a rush to the end of the room, where the cook
is usually stationed.&nbsp; And now happy is he who possesses the
Yankee&rsquo;s qualification for a good diner-out, for unless he
has a long arm, a quick eye, and a silent tongue, he is likely to
come off with much less than a dollar&rsquo;s worth.&nbsp; The
experienced traveller, before sitting down, gathers all the
dishes before him, within arm&rsquo;s length, and then proceeds
to attack them <i>seriatim</i>, or <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>sometimes all at once.&nbsp; Indeed,
I think a man of naturally generous disposition, would be made
utterly selfish by twelve months&rsquo; travelling on American
railroads.&nbsp; As soon as the half-hour has gone, the guard
calls out with a shrill, nasal, Yankee twang, &ldquo;All
aboard,&rdquo; and we once more continue our journey.</p>
<p>Happening one day to say to a fellow-passenger that I was from
Birmingham, an American gentleman hearing me came across the
carriage, and, raising his hat, said: &ldquo;I <i>must</i> shake
hands with a person coming from the city which returns John
Bright to Parliament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Pacific Railroad is a single track, and, although a
wonderful engineering work, is not by any means a substantial or
confidence-inspiring line, if judged by English standards.&nbsp;
The rails are old and worn, the bridges and viaducts very lightly
constructed, and almost always of wood.&nbsp; I observed in
several cases that the carriages were actually wider than the
viaducts, many of which are open between the rails.&nbsp; It is
hardly to be wondered at that awful accidents sometimes
occur.&nbsp; The train in which we were travelling narrowly
escaped falling into a ravine 120 feet deep.&nbsp; One dark
night, after we had all retired to rest, we were awakened by
continued whistling and ringing of bells.&nbsp; It was in vain
that we inquired of the guards and attendants as to what was
going on, for they, like their brethren all the world over, would
give no information.&nbsp; One thing, however, they could not
hide from us, for we found we were being taken across a viaduct
one carriage at a time, and as we crossed we could see lights
moving about at a great depth below.&nbsp; On arriving at Omaha,
<a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>two days
later, we found a full report of the occurrence in the
papers.&nbsp; It appears that the viaduct had been discovered to
be in an unsafe condition, some of its timbers having been
partially burnt, and it was a matter of discussion whether we
should be allowed to cross at all; it being ultimately
determined, as I have said, to take one car over at a time.&nbsp;
Ours was the last train that went over, for before daylight the
whole structure had fallen with a tremendous crash.&nbsp; The
Indians were on the war-path at the time, and it was supposed
that the work of destruction was theirs.&nbsp; The railway here
runs through some of the most magnificent scenery in the
world.&nbsp; Sometimes its course lies through narrow valleys, or
ca&ntilde;ons, where there is just room for the railway and the
river, sometimes through immense pine forests, and then again on
a mere shelf cut in the face of the granite mountain, until the
point called &ldquo;Cape Horn&rdquo; is reached.&nbsp; This is
the turning-point between east and west, and soon afterwards the
greatest elevation is attained, 8,200 feet.&nbsp; About sixty
miles of the more exposed portion of the road is covered with
sheds, to protect it from the snow.&nbsp; This result, however,
is not attained without considerable discomfort to the
passengers, as the carriages become filled with smoke and dust
while passing through.</p>
<p>One of the passengers on our train was an old man who had not
crossed the country since he went out to the far west some
twenty-six years before&mdash;long before the railway had been
thought of.&nbsp; The party with which he then travelled was so
large that it had to be split into detachments for the
convenience of pasturage.&nbsp; One night his section was
attacked by Indians, who <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>killed several of the party and
drove off most of the horses and cattle.&nbsp; The old man had
for many years been a trapper in the Indian country and had
invested his hard-won earnings in horses which he was taking out
west for the purpose of trade, and he was not disposed to lose
them all at one fell swoop without making a bold dash for their
recovery.&nbsp; His plan of operations was soon settled, and in
the evening he set off in pursuit with half-a-dozen picked men,
each with his rifle and a good store of ammunition.&nbsp; After
some hours they came upon the scent of the Indians, and moving
cautiously forward amongst the scrub, presently saw them around
their fires busily engaged in dividing the spoils of the
morning.&nbsp; The trapper being a first-rate marksman, it was
agreed he should do all the firing, while the others loaded and
handed up the rifles as fast as required.&nbsp; Every shot told,
and the redskins, judging from the rapid firing that the whole
party of white men were upon them, made a regular stampede,
leaving horses, and cattle, and other spoil behind them.&nbsp;
So, painfully marching on, they came at last to the Mormon
settlement and on to the Salt Lake City, where they were
subjected to the most cruel treatment at the hands of the
&ldquo;Saints.&rdquo;&nbsp; These people told the travellers it
was impossible to get to California by the route they were
taking, as the country was swarming with hostile Indians, and
they undertook to show them a better way by which they would get
there in fifteen days.&nbsp; Many suspected treachery, and a
consultation was held, which came to no definite conclusion,
except in the case of one man, who, in the heat of debate, was
shot dead.&nbsp; It was ultimately decided to adopt the <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Mormon
advice, and as the route did not admit of wagons, they tried to
sell them to the &ldquo;Saints,&rdquo; who, of course, would not
buy, knowing they would have them for nothing before long.&nbsp;
Many of the travellers burnt their wagons and harness rather than
that the Mormons should have them, but the majority abandoned
theirs, and set out without them.&nbsp; Instead of fifteen days
the journey took thirty-nine, and only a few survived it, most of
the party dying by the way, either by the hand of the Indians or
from fatigue.</p>
<p>For about a thousand miles the railway is open to the prairie,
the consequence being that frequent accidents occur through
cattle straying upon the track.&nbsp; I counted more than twenty
carcases of these unfortunates in one day, and on one occasion,
while sitting on the steps of the Pullman car, I felt a sudden
check, and immediately after the body of a cow flew past.&nbsp;
The herds are looked after by men with lassoes, riding very fleet
horses.&nbsp; American railroads being much less protected from
stray animals than those in England, the locomotives are provided
with an apparatus called a &ldquo;cow-catcher,&rdquo; which
consists of an iron framework projecting in front and inclined
downwards as near to the rails as possible.&nbsp; The contrivance
is successful in moving most living obstacles from the
track.&nbsp; For instance, when a cow gets between the rails and
sees the train approaching, it becomes dazed, and the iron frame
striking the lower portion of the legs takes it up readily.&nbsp;
But with a bull it is quite different: when his lordship sees his
enemy approaching he puts his chin down upon his fore-feet and
waits the onset with a confidence not by any means always <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>misplaced,
for in this position his head and feet form a wedge which,
becoming inserted beneath the iron frame, frequently throws the
engine back upon the train, causing serious accidents.&nbsp; When
at Ogden I saw the remains of a goods train which had been
wrecked in this way a week before, the engine drivers being
killed, also two stow-aways, or &ldquo;dead-heads,&rdquo; as the
Yankees call them, who had secreted themselves under one of the
carriages.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Waking one morning we found ourselves in a most awfully
desolate country, with scarcely a sign of vegetation&mdash;a
veritable dry and thirsty land, through which we travelled all
day.&nbsp; Towards evening we came to the alkali country, and the
plains looked as though they were covered with snow.&nbsp; This
is a fearful place, where, before the construction of the
railway, many poor emigrants have lain down to die.&nbsp; Soon
after, we skirted the margin of the Great Salt Lake and entered
Brigham Young&rsquo;s dominions, passing his first town,
&ldquo;Corinn&eacute;.&rdquo;&nbsp; This town was founded by the
Gentiles after Brigham turned them out of the Salt Lake City, but
he soon drove them farther off.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>We
left the train at Odgen in order to pay a short visit to the Salt
Lake City, which is situated thirty-six miles off, and is
approached by a railway belonging to the Saints.&nbsp; For beauty
of situation Salt Lake City is almost unrivalled.&nbsp; It lies
in a basin more than twenty miles in diameter, and is surrounded
by mountains, some of which are 12,000 feet high, and most of
them covered with perpetual snow.&nbsp; At the time of our visit
the fruit-trees were in full bloom, and, as each house is
surrounded by its garden, the city occupies a large extent of
ground, presenting a beautiful appearance from the United States
camp, which stands on an elevation commanding the whole city,
about two miles off.&nbsp; A portion of the old mud wall, about
ten feet high, built by the Mormons to resist the attack of the
Indians, still remains standing.&nbsp; Several of the houses are
exceedingly well built, and the gardens kept in excellent order;
one in particular I was much struck with, and remarked to our
guide that it was the brightest and best kept place I had seen
since leaving England.&nbsp; He told me it belonged to an
Englishman who had left for his native country on the previous
day.&nbsp; Curiously enough, when I returned home, I found this
man was a brother of my butcher, and was then on a visit
home.&nbsp; We observed two ladies sitting in the front of the
house engaged in needlework, and were told that they were the two
wives of the English Mormon.&nbsp; It was very noticeable that
these ladies sat at a considerable distance apart, cordiality
(unless it be of hatred) not being a characteristic of these
Mormon wives in their relations with each other.&nbsp; At the
time of our visit the &ldquo;Prophet&rdquo; was down south,
looking out for a new <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>location for the Saints, in view of
the threatened difficulties with the Central Government.&nbsp; We
visited the Tabernacle, and saw the preparations for the new
temple, to which the deluded of all nations continue to
contribute, although it is exceedingly doubtful that the building
will be carried to completion.&nbsp; The man who showed us over
the Tabernacle used to work in a London factory; but he told us
with a curious twinkle in his eye that the &ldquo;new job&rdquo;
paid him much the best.&nbsp; At a short distance from the city
there is a sulphur spring, of considerable volume, proceeding
from the side of the mountains; the temperature of the water is
such that eggs can be boiled in it.&nbsp; We slept at Ogden that
night in order to be in good time for securing places in the
train going east in the morning.&nbsp; When the hotel bill was
presented I tendered English gold in payment, having disposed of
my U.S. currency.&nbsp; The landlord refused to take it, saying,
&ldquo;He would not have the &mdash; British gold.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
explained to him that I had no other money, but to no purpose,
so, as the train was almost due, I told him I would pay him when
I came that way again, but was not sure when that would be.&nbsp;
He quietly said, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll take your gold,&rdquo;
much to the amusement of the bystanders.&nbsp; At the station
here is a printed notice cautioning travellers to &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Beware of Bogus Ticket Sellers</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For three days after leaving Ogden we travelled through the
snow, passing through a series of ca&ntilde;ons or gorges, which
narrow at the base until there is just room for the brawling
stream which runs along the bottom.&nbsp; The railway in such
cases is either excavated on one side of the gorge or carried on
trestles over the <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>stream.&nbsp; The rocks on the mountain sides, mostly
of red sandstone, are very bold and of strange shapes.&nbsp;
Amongst them is a very weird-looking group called &ldquo;The
Witches.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another group, known as &ldquo;The
Buttes,&rdquo; bears a most striking resemblance to a line of
strong fortifications commanding the valley.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p158.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>We saw these at sunset, and the effect of the evening light
upon the red sandstone was very fine.&nbsp; In the same
neighbourhood is the celebrated Devil&rsquo;s Slide; it is formed
by the earth being gradually washed away from between two lines
of vertical strata about 20ft. apart.&nbsp; It is <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>some
hundreds of feet in length, and descends into the river.&nbsp;
This valley was the route taken by the Western Pioneers, and is
marked here and there by solitary graves with crosses at their
heads.</p>

<p>The whole 8,000 feet descent from the summit to the eastern
plains is made in about four hours.&nbsp; The steam is turned
off, the brakes turned on, and down we go.&nbsp; As we were
preparing to descend I remarked to the negro attendant that I
supposed we must trust the engineer now?&nbsp; &ldquo;No,
sah,&rdquo; said Sambo, &ldquo;I guess we must trust de ole man
up above,&rdquo; pointing to the skies.</p>

160</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p>On reaching Chicago we left &ldquo;the overland train,&rdquo;
with the object of paying a short visit to Niagara.&nbsp; The
last stage of our long ride was from Omaha, during which we
crossed the Missouri and Mississippi.&nbsp; There being three
competing lines to Chicago the pace became greatly accelerated,
so much so that during a considerable portion of the long ride it
was almost impossible to stand on one&rsquo;s feet, and the
country being very dry, the train was enveloped in a cloud of
dust almost the whole of the way.&nbsp; We had, however, one
compensation, for attached to the train was a well-appointed
dining-car, with first-rate cuisine.&nbsp; The viands were of the
choicest quality, and in great variety.&nbsp; Moreover, the speed
of the train was slackened during meals, an arrangement affording
a degree of comfort unknown on the Pacific Line.&nbsp; The bill
of fare is a curiosity in its way, being garnished with
appetising mottoes and sentiments, such <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>as,
&ldquo;As you journey through life live by the way,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Eat and be satisfied,&rdquo; and concluding with an
expression of belief that passengers would appreciate this new
feature of &ldquo;Life on the Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In going through Chicago we were much surprised by the fine
and substantial-looking buildings in every part of the
city.&nbsp; There are fifty to one hundred streets, any one of
which is equal to the best in London; indeed, it struck me as
being more of a city than any place I had ever been in.&nbsp; We
observed a whole block of buildings, including a bank on the
ground floor, and offices above, being removed bodily without any
disturbance of the business operations going on in it.&nbsp; The
water for the city supply is taken from Lake Michigan through a
pipe which extends two miles into the lake.&nbsp; The capacity of
the pumping engines is seventy-five millions of gallons per day,
the greatest demand being forty-five millions.&nbsp; During the
last few years there have been many disastrous fires in Chicago,
directly traceable to the general employment of timber not only
in buildings, but for the side walks and roadways.&nbsp; The
broad streets referred to above are, however, constructed of a
fine warm-coloured sandstone, and all the new streets are being
made of the same material.&nbsp; Nevertheless, a considerable
number of timber houses remain, constituting a standing danger to
the city.&nbsp; While in Chicago I found my passport
useful.&nbsp; On going to the bank to get some money on my Letter
of Credit the manager told me they had not received a copy of my
signature from the bank in England, and that in its absence they
could not honour my draft.&nbsp; It was in vain that I showed him
my watch and other articles <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>having my name engraved upon
them.&nbsp; He looked at them as though he thought there were
various ways of getting possession of such articles.&nbsp; I told
him I regretted I had not been born with my name on my person,
but I was not accountable for the omission.&nbsp; I then thought
of my passport, and although he appeared to think that it was
possible to obtain possession of that improperly, he accepted it
with the remark that &ldquo;even that is not conclusive,&rdquo;
for it should have had a description of my person.&nbsp; We
stayed at the Grand Pacific Hotel, which formed a great contrast
to the Palace Hotel at San Francisco, being uncomfortable and
badly administered.</p>
<p>At Detroit we cross the frontier into Canada, travelling over
the Great Western Railway to Niagara.&nbsp; This line was
constructed by English contractors, and the superiority of the
work is manifested in the smooth, steady motion of the
carriages.&nbsp; Compared with the lines we had previously
traversed this was most comfortable.&nbsp; We pass through
London, Paris, and other places with equally celebrated names,
greatly enjoying the forest scenery, numerous clearings and
bright little homesteads dotted over the country; and for the
first time since leaving England seeing lovely green fields such
as we have at home.&nbsp; At Niagara we stopped at the famous
Clifton House, where we were joined by friends from England.</p>
<p>Our impressions of Niagara were those common to most
visitors&mdash;first, a feeling of disappointment, soon
succeeded, however, by an ever-increasing sense of the immensity
and magnificence of the Falls, which grows upon one the more one
sees them.</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>A
sentiment of disgust, however, is inspired by the ruthless
desecration of the most beautiful spots by Yankee manufacturers,
who have chosen such picturesque positions for their smoky
factories.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Another annoyance constantly experienced is from the
peripatetic photographer, who endeavours to persuade you that you
are greater than the &ldquo;Falls.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Falls,
indeed, are made to seem a mere background to your photograph, <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>in which he
is careful to show you nearest the camera, and hence
proportionately by far the most imposing object.</p>
<p>To get into Canada we have to cross the suspension
bridge.&nbsp; Going over one day we purchased about &pound;1
worth of photographs of Canadian scenery.&nbsp; On returning with
them we were accosted by the American customs officer, who
mulcted us in nearly twenty shillings duty.&nbsp; On entering his
office to obtain a receipt we observed a
&ldquo;six-shooter&rdquo; at his right hand, presumably for the
purpose of persuasion.&nbsp; On leaving the place I met an
American policeman and told him what a shabby transaction it was
for the representatives of so great a country.&nbsp; He replied
that he guessed the officer must raise his salary.&nbsp; I
refrain from any attempt to describe the mighty Falls of
Niagara.</p>
<p>On our way to New York we travelled by railway to Albany, the
capital of the State of New York, passing through Syracuse, Rome,
and Utica, along the shores of Lake Ontario, although from the
lowering of the ground and the abundance of trees we were unable
to see the lake; thence alongside the Falls River, through very
charmingly diversified country with numerous valleys going up
from the waterside, well-timbered, and here and there a clearing
with open green fields.&nbsp; The houses are in most cases
mean-looking plank erections, presenting a very weather-beaten
appearance, some painted a very dark red colour.&nbsp; In the
evening we reached Albany, an old Dutch town of over two hundred
years, and very Dutch-looking it is with its queer red-brick
houses, wooden pavements, and trees along the streets, and
frequent peeps of the river here and there.&nbsp; Amongst <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>the finest
public buildings are those devoted to the national schools, a
true gauge of the importance the citizens attach to the education
of the people.&nbsp; On our way to New York we had an opportunity
of taking a day&rsquo;s sail on the River Hudson in one of the
celebrated American river-boats.&nbsp; Going on board we found
ourselves on a veritable floating palace.&nbsp; The steamer was a
three-decker, two of the decks being covered with splendid
carpets, and fitted with arm-chairs of a most comfortable
pattern, and with velvet-covered ottomans and couches in all
directions.&nbsp; Taking up one of the books from the
well-stocked bookstall I saw it purported to be one of a series
of standard works by American authors, and on looking down the
list I observed the names of Tennyson, Barry Cornwall, and
others.&nbsp; Our American cousins were always great at
annexation, and the only wonder is they do not call their mother
tongue the &ldquo;American language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Americans seem anxious that everyone shall admit that the
Hudson is finer than any other river in the world.&nbsp; I have
been down the Elbe, through the Saxon Switzerland, also down the
Danube and the Rhine.&nbsp; The Hudson is far more beautiful than
the Rhine.&nbsp; The banks are thickly wooded, and the villages
and country houses prettily situated.&nbsp; It is true that the
Hudson lacks the romantic associations of the Rhine, but even in
this respect it is not altogether wanting, for does it not
possess the Catskill Mountains, with their legend of Rip Van
Winkle?&nbsp; But I like the Danube best; its banks are loftier
and more rugged, and are covered with pines, and from its
comparative narrowness one can see both sides at once.&nbsp; Then
<a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>again,
the ancient towns and monasteries jutting out on the spits of
land are infinitely more interesting than the wooden houses along
the Hudson.&nbsp; Again, the Elbe, especially in the Saxon
Switzerland, is decidedly more beautiful than the Hudson; but for
all this the latter is a river of which a nation may well be
proud, and we greatly enjoyed our sail upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p166.jpg">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>On a
subsequent visit to the Hudson we landed at West Point, the seat
of the celebrated military academy founded by Washington, where
there are some hundreds of students.&nbsp; Our hotel was situated
about two miles from the academy, and overlooked the river from
an eminence of about two hundred feet.&nbsp; The river can be
seen for some miles winding between steep banks on both
sides.&nbsp; The morning after our arrival was a Sunday, and the
church bells were ringing for service.&nbsp; There are two
opposition churches here, but I have reason to believe they are
very charitable to one another; at all events their respective
bell-ringers do not believe in the jarring of the sects, for I
notice that first one rings out
one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four; then a decent pause, and
his neighbour likewise rings out
one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four, and so the celestial
harmonies are not disturbed.</p>
<p>On the opposite bank of the river is a place historic in the
annals of the Revolution, for here it was that the American
General Arnold was stationed while he was carrying on his
treasonable correspondence with the ill-fated Major
Andr&eacute;.&nbsp; Arnold was sitting at breakfast with his
officers and some guests when word was brought him that
Andr&eacute; was captured as a spy by the Americans.&nbsp;
Knowing he would surely be incriminated, Arnold pretended he was
wanted below on urgent business, and, going down to Beverley
landing, he ordered his men to row him to the British man-of-war
lying in the river.&nbsp; Poor Andr&eacute;, it will be
remembered, was hanged by order of Washington.&nbsp; His bust was
placed in Westminster Abbey; three times since then has it been
mutilated by miscreants.&nbsp; Walking through <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the village
we observed a mean-looking tumble-down tenement, with an equally
mean-looking signboard stuck upon it, bearing this
inscription:&mdash;&ldquo;John Scales, Justice of the Peace,
Notary Public.&rdquo;&nbsp; His &ldquo;Honour&rdquo; was sitting
inside, in his shirt-sleeves, with a white apron on, while behind
him on a shelf were a few old dry-as-dust books, of the law I
suppose.&nbsp; The whole place looked totally at variance with
our ideas of the majesty of the law; indeed it suggested that
&ldquo;justice&rdquo; could be had for the buying, and that no
one was expected to pay much regard to the decision of such a
court.&nbsp; On returning to the hotel I spoke of this
functionary to the negro waiter, suggesting that he <i>dealt</i>
in justice, &ldquo;Yes, sah; I guess a dollar will go a long way
with him,&rdquo; replied he.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Ascending the mountain we came across an old man at work on
the roads.&nbsp; He was a German, having come to America in
1841.&nbsp; He served in the Mexican war, and one of his sons was
killed in the war against <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>the Southern rebels.&nbsp; The old
man said it was hard work mending roads, and that the winters
were very severe, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is a free
country, and that makes up for all.&nbsp; In Germany a man dares
not open his mouth, but here one can say what one
likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing by a farmyard our curiosity was aroused by seeing the
stock of poultry secured by the leg to the fence.&nbsp; As we had
often heard in our travels in the States that this was &ldquo;a
great country,&rdquo; we presume this was an expedient adopted to
prevent the fowls straying and being lost.&nbsp; Of course,
England being so small, such precautions are not necessary.</p>
<p>We returned to New York in another of the celebrated
river-boats.</p>
<p>During my stay in the States there were two great subjects
which monopolised public attention.&nbsp; These were the
Centennial Exhibition which had just been opened: and the wave of
corruption among officials and others which was sweeping over the
land.&nbsp; More space was occupied in the Press by charges of
malversation and fraud on the part of the officials, from the
President down to the lowest civil service clerks, and from them
through all grades of society, than with the Exhibition itself or
with any other subject, while the talk in the streets seemed to
be about nothing else.&nbsp; In alluding to the unlawful gains
made in this way by many prominent citizens, a New York paper
made use of a sentiment of Mark Twain to the effect that whereas
in times past folks used to say &ldquo;poor but honest,&rdquo;
now-a-days when you see a rich man who has accumulated money in a
proper way it is said that he is &ldquo;rich but
honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>I
have travelled in many countries, but in almost everything have
found America twice as dear as any other country.&nbsp; The
charges are simply monstrous.&nbsp; Having to go from an hotel to
the steam wharf, we were not permitted to take our very modest
amount of luggage in the omnibus with us, although we had the
vehicle all to ourselves; but the hotel people insisted upon
sending it in a special wagon, charging two dollars for what a
cabman in Birmingham would willingly have done for a
shilling.&nbsp; On board the steamer we were charged six
shillings each for a plain dinner, without wine, which in England
would not have cost more than 1s. 6d.&nbsp; Bound books are
equally dear.&nbsp; Pocket volumes, containing not more than
one-sixth of the matter in a shilling volume of Chambers&rsquo;
&ldquo;Miscellany of Entertaining Tracts,&rdquo; were charged two
shillings each.&nbsp; Most of the newspapers, also, are very
inferior to, yet much dearer than, the English papers.&nbsp;
Another form of extortion is to be found in the impossibility, in
many hotels, of obtaining information as to the sailing of
river-boats, departure of trains, etc., the only apparent
explanation being a desire to give &ldquo;touts&rdquo; and
&ldquo;loungers,&rdquo; of whom there are many, opportunities of
extorting money.&nbsp; These fellows seem to know nothing unless
they can hear the dollars chink, or see the dirty greenbacks (and
some of them are very dirty).&nbsp; A fellow once gave me in
change a dollar note which was so filthy that scarcely a word was
legible upon it.&nbsp; It looked as though it might contain
smallpox or typhoid, so I asked him to wash it.&nbsp; He said he
guessed he would&mdash;<i>for a dollar</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>Against all this, I am bound to say that the charges
made by the steamboat companies and most of the railways are
exceedingly moderate, and their arrangements in connection with
baggage most convenient.&nbsp; On arriving at any of the large
cities by river-boat, the agent of the Luggage Express Company
comes on board and takes possession of your baggage, giving
vouchers for it.&nbsp; He also undertakes to collect any baggage
you may have sent to the City Railway Station from distant parts
of the country, and very soon after you arrive at your hotel it
is brought to you.&nbsp; At the landing stages in such cities as
New York there are numbers of cabs, mostly driven by Irishmen,
and when they find you have disposed of your luggage and do not
require their services, they give vent to their disgust in no
measured terms, and if the traveller is a Britisher, he is soon
reminded of the fact.</p>
<p>The mode of dealing with baggage on the railway is almost
equally convenient.&nbsp; The following will give some idea of
it.&nbsp; You are travelling, say, from Aberdeen to Penzance,
intending ultimately to proceed by way of London to Dover, and do
not require the bulk of your luggage till you arrive at the
latter place.&nbsp; On leaving Aberdeen, the Baggage Master takes
your superfluous luggage, putting brass labels upon it,

<p>We visited the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia for the
purpose of inspecting the various productions <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>corresponding to our own, hoping, indeed expecting, to
find something which would repay us for coming.&nbsp; We were,
indeed, repaid, but in a sense totally opposed to what we
expected, for we found that so far from Americans being in
advance of the English, they were, in many cases, taking credit
for so-called &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; (claiming them as
novelties), which we had been familiar with, and had used in our
own works many years before.&nbsp; They appear to be strangely
unaware of what has been done in European countries, and a single
instance will illustrate this.&nbsp; The machinery in the
Exhibition was driven by a single large steam-engine.&nbsp; The
newspapers made a great deal of this engine, declaring that it
was the largest in the world, and that it had been made in the
smallest State&mdash;Rhode Island.&nbsp; An American engineer
with evident pride took us to see the big engine, which, after
all, had a cylinder of only 70in. diameter.&nbsp; We told him
that five-and-twenty years before a small engineering firm in
Cornwall, England, had made several engines with cylinders 144in.
in diameter, and which are yet at work.</p>
<p>We were permitted to inspect some of the most important
engineering establishments, and found the tools of such an
inferior character that our only wonder was that they could
produce either good or cheap work.&nbsp; In most cases the floors
of the workshops were inches deep in ferruginous dust.&nbsp;
Under such conditions every time a heavy casting is dropped on
the floor a cloud of dust must rise, and entering the bearings of
the tools, cut them up badly.&nbsp; We found many of the tools
actually wedged up because of this.</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>An
American manufacturer speaking to me of a visit he had paid to
the Exhibition in company with his foreman, told me how
astonished the latter was at the excellence of the European
exhibits.&nbsp; He said he had no idea they could make the things
half so well, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they are almost
as good as ours,&rdquo; and, I added, &ldquo;only one half the
cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agricultural machinery was exhibited in a separate
building erected specially for its reception, and here the
Americans were unmistakably far ahead of all competitors.</p>
<p>At the time of our visit several consignments of calicoes had
been made to England and to various British markets, and sold at
prices considerably below what they could be produced at by
English manufacturers.&nbsp; This incursion occasioned great
disquietude in England until the cause was manifested&mdash;viz.,
overproduction.&nbsp; On this point I read an article in a New
York Protectionist paper intended as an answer to the Free Trade
argument, that Protection increased the price of goods.&nbsp; The
article stated that this was not so: and to prove its position
said that the tendency of Protection was to induce people to go
into manufacturing who know little or nothing of the processes
they were undertaking, but who fancy that with the tariff of from
40 per cent. to 80 per cent. upon foreign goods, there must
necessarily be a sufficient margin to compensate for mistakes
caused by their inexperience.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so it
happens,&rdquo; continues the writer, &ldquo;that there is great
over-production, ruinous competition among American
manufacturers, frequent failures, and consequently large stocks
of goods are forced on the markets at a great loss, the public
getting <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>cheap supplies in consequence.&rdquo;&nbsp; Adam Smith
would scarcely have quoted this as one of the methods of adding
to the wealth of nations.&nbsp; But if the people at large obtain
their cotton goods cheaper through this system of
over-production, it is clear that the millowners are not the only
sufferers, for it appears from a speech delivered by Mr. Shearman
of New York, at the Cobden Club dinner in the present year
(1883), that the wages of the factory operatives are twenty per
cent. less than in Lancashire, while their hours of labour are
from eighteen to twenty per cent. longer.</p>
<p>During the late Fair Trade agitation its advocates were never
tired of telling the English working-classes that under
Protection their brethren in America were prospering in a
remarkable degree, but in the speech to which I have referred Mr.
Shearman shows that the average wages in protected trades are
actually less than in 1860, the last year of comparative Free
Trade, and that while in the ten years previous, wages were
constantly increasing, during the succeeding twenty years
(1860&ndash;1880) there was no appreciable advance, while during
the past three years they have been steadily declining; so that
here we have one of the staple trades of the country requiring
longer hours of labour from the operatives, at considerably lower
wages than for the same class in England, while the cost of
living is much higher than in this country, and the climate much
more trying from the extremes of heat and cold.</p>
<p>Nor is this all, for the American operatives have very much
less relaxation than the same class in England, their holidays
being very much fewer.&nbsp; Last year my workpeople, in addition
to fifty-two Saturday <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>afternoons, had nineteen whole days,
although there was abundance of work for them, and the
necessities of the business only required six days closing of the
works.&nbsp; The English artisan loves to have a deal of liberty,
and his earnings enable him to indulge his desire in that
respect.</p>
<p>As may be supposed, the ranks of the operatives in the cotton
mills of America receive no accession from England, but only from
Germany and Scandinavia, where wages are low, and the oppressive
military systems drive people from their native countries.</p>
<p>During the last seven years of depression in trade in England
it is well known that, taken as a whole, the working classes have
suffered comparatively little, the loss falling mainly upon
manufacturers, whose profits have been greatly lessened.&nbsp;
But how would the working-classes have fared if, in addition to
the loss of home trade involved in the failure of the crops for
so many years, the same causes were in operation which make it
impossible for America to have a great foreign trade?</p>
<p>It is manifest that so long as Protection exists in the United
States exports must necessarily be confined almost entirely to
such commodities as other countries cannot produce.&nbsp; Until
recently the home demand has kept the manufacturers in the States
well employed; but competition has now become exceedingly fierce,
and they are beginning to tread upon each other&rsquo;s
heels.&nbsp; It is this state of things which is destined to
exert the most potent influence upon the fate of
Protection.&nbsp; The very class which has hitherto been loudest
in demanding prohibitory duties upon imports, will soon, from
sheer necessity, be found demanding their removal.</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>It is
worthy of note, too, that while under Protection the earnings of
the producing class have been steadily declining, colossal
fortunes, amounting in one case to twenty or thirty millions
sterling, have been built up by individual monopolists.&nbsp; On
the other hand, during the same period and under Free Trade,
there has been a wider distribution of material comfort in
England, and, as shown by the official returns, a decided
decrease in the number of millionaires.</p>
<p>In passing through America on my return from Australia in
1876, I expressed the opinion that Free Trade there would be by
no means an unmixed blessing for English manufacturers, for
whereas at the present time a vessel going to Australia from the
United States with a cargo of goods has to come back in ballast,
doubling the cost of freight, under Free Trade it would take back
a cargo of wool, and the Americans would consequently become our
competitors both in buying and selling.</p>
<p>With the single exception of having higher wages&mdash;and
this advantage is more than balanced by the extra cost of
living&mdash;I have failed to find that American artisans are in
any way better off than the English, while, as I have already
shown, their hours of labour are longer and the effect of the
climate much more exhausting.</p>
<p>A very striking feature to be met with in most American cities
and towns is the large number of tolerably respectable-looking
men loafing about and doing nothing.&nbsp; In England such men,
only in shabbier dress, would be called
&ldquo;cadgers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am told there are large numbers
who prefer any shifty mode of obtaining a living so long as they
can wear a black coat <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>and avoid honest labour.&nbsp; In
the villages along the banks of the Hudson I saw more children
without shoes and stockings than are to be met with in any part
of England in a similar area.&nbsp; They go to school shoeless,
and a woman told me that when shoes were put on their feet on
Sundays they complained loudly.&nbsp; A land of freedom for
tongue and foot!</p>
<p>During the Southern rebellion fears were expressed that the
result of emancipation would be to flood the markets of the North
with negro labour, but this does not appear to have been the
case.&nbsp; As long as slavery existed the North was attractive
to the negro as the land of freedom, but when freedom was
proclaimed throughout the States the negro naturally elected to
remain where he had always been&mdash;the climate and
surroundings being well suited to him.&nbsp; The head waiter at
our hotel at West Point was a slave in Richmond until the middle
of the war, when he escaped to Washington.&nbsp; I asked him how
he got there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, by the underground railway,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; It took him a week to travel the hundred miles,
and he had many narrow escapes, but was fortunate enough to come
out all right and to get a situation to wait upon one of Abraham
Lincoln&rsquo;s sons.&nbsp; He told me his owner, a lady, taught
him to read and write in face of the certainty of being sent to
jail in case of being discovered.&nbsp; His father was sold away
down south sixteen years before, but since that day they had
again met at Richmond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;neither Jeff. Davis nor any of his crew will ever play you
such pranks again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No Sir,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>The regulation of the liquor traffic in the American cities
appears to present as many difficulties as it does <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>in England,
especially as regards the Sunday traffic.&nbsp; The Sunday before
we left New York the police made a raid upon the liquor dealers
in the city, and arrested a number of them for selling during
prohibited hours.&nbsp; Their organs threatened all sorts of
reprisals at the coming election, and a meeting of the trade was
called to condemn the action of the authorities.&nbsp; Most of
the requisitionists&mdash;judging by their names&mdash;were
either German or Irish.&nbsp; At the time appointed some hundreds
of liquor dealers assembled, and presently a gentleman came on
the platform and began to address them.&nbsp; Soon, however, it
began to dawn upon the trade that they had been somewhat
considerably sold, for the speaker gave them a regular teetotal
lecture, enlarging upon the evils the dealers were responsible
for, and warning them to forsake their wicked ways.&nbsp; The
audience could not stand this, and threatened the orator that if
he didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;make tracks right away&rdquo; they would
give him &ldquo;something hot,&rdquo; upon which he quietly
retired, having given them the first temperance lecture they had
ever heard.</p>
<p>Our visit to America was brought to a fitting termination by
another glorious excursion on the Hudson: after which it was with
great pleasure and satisfaction that we went on board one of the
splendid White Star Liners, soon to land again on the shores of
dear old England.</p>
<h2><a name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
181</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p>We arrived off Suez about four o&rsquo;clock on the morning of
the 1st of March, having travelled from Australia in the
magnificent steamship &ldquo;Orient.&rdquo;&nbsp; After saying
farewell to our friends, at seven o&rsquo;clock we set out for
the shore, our boat being manned by a picturesque party of Arabs.
We had about four miles to go, the latter portion of the journey
being through water so shallow that the men had to propel the
boat by nimbly running forward and placing one end of the oar in
the mud and pushing against the other with the shoulder; singing
a monotonous song all the while.&nbsp; On arriving at our
landing-place opposite the Custom House, a motley crowd rushed
forward, some dressed in night-shirts, some in towels, others in
their own black skins only. When we stopped, a score of them
dashed into the water and began to seize our luggage, seeing
which our boatmen called to us to beat them on the head with our
umbrellas, and to kick them off; but we <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>managed to
defend our property by loud words, which broke no bones.&nbsp;
Then we were carried ashore amidst such shrieking, hustling,
jostling, and shouting as I had never heard or seen before.&nbsp;
The luggage was set down in the middle of the square to await the
arrival of an official from the Custom House.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p182.jpg">
<img alt=
"A Dragoman"
title=

src="images/p182.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>After a very slight examination we were permitted to pass, and
then began another battle for the luggage; but we selected as our
dragoman a tall, stout fellow named Hassan, who quickly routed
the others; and then a file of these half-naked Arabs marched off
to the hotel with the luggage on their backs.&nbsp; The Suez
Hotel is a very comfortable establishment, with large, clean, and
airy rooms, and bright and attentive native servants.</p>
<p>After breakfast we went for a stroll through the town.&nbsp;
The streets are very narrow, and the tiny <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>shops are
filled with vegetables and other garden produce, oils, simple
metal wares, etc.&nbsp; In one street the Bedouin Arabs have
stalls for the sale of charcoal, brought by them from the desert;
a very sullen, repulsive set of fellows they appear to be.&nbsp;
There are few European buildings, and what there are were built
for the French officials during the construction of the
Canal.&nbsp; These were all vacated during the Franco-German war,
and very few French have since returned, consequently the houses
are in a very dilapidated condition.</p>
<p>Before leaving England we had arranged for a party of our
friends to meet us at Suez, and on returning from our stroll in
the town, we walked for a while in the large inner court of the
hotel, when presently we saw our friends entering, they having
landed just three hours after our arrival from Australia.</p>
<p>After lunch, nine of us took donkeys and had a ride round the
town and neighbourhood.&nbsp; Not being assured of my riding
ability, I asked my companions to keep near me, which they
promised to do, and which they doubtless would have done if they
could; but alas! their noble brutes dashed off at full speed, and
I was left alone.&nbsp; At every street corner stood a mob of
darkies shouting, laughing, and begging, and calling out the
names of the various donkeys, &ldquo;Mrs. Langtry,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Mrs. Cornwallis West&rdquo; (this was mine), &ldquo;Mr.
Spurgeon,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; On getting back to the hotel gates
there was a crowd of about fifty donkeys, all their fifty drivers
wanting us to engage them for our next ride, and it required a
vigorous use of Hassan&rsquo;s stick to clear a passage for
us.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>On
the following morning we left for Cairo by train, and in due time
Hassan appeared with about a dozen men and a shaky old wagon to
take our luggage to the station, and truly it was a formidable
lot&mdash;a lady and gentleman from Australia having no less than
nine trunks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>At the hotel gate stood the usual fifty donkeys, their drivers
all shrieking out to you to take their donkeys.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
donkey good donkey, sah; his name, Mrs. Langtry.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Dis donkey, Sir Roggar (<i>sic</i>) Tichborne, sah;
he go gentle.&rdquo;&nbsp; You have to push through the crowd of
men and animals as you best can.&nbsp; The <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>never-ceasing word <i>backsheesh</i>, or its
abbreviation <i>&rsquo;sheesh</i>, hissing in your ear all the
way.&nbsp; On suddenly turning a corner you may come upon a lot
of children or grown-up people engaged in play or other
occupation, but they are always ready.&nbsp; Their hands are
immediately stretched out, and the cry is on their lips,
<i>&rsquo;sheesh</i>! <i>&rsquo;sheesh</i>! nor do they seem
surprised if you fail to respond.&nbsp; Sometimes I vary it by
putting out my own hand, with temporary success as far as
checking their begging goes, but they are soon equal to the
occasion, and with mock gravity will offer a quarter
piastre&mdash;about a halfpenny&mdash;and then you laugh and they
laugh.</p>
<p>I had often read, that properly to understand Biblical
allusions it is necessary to travel in the East.&nbsp; This
constant extending of the hand for <i>backsheesh</i> gave me an
entirely new appreciation of the passage, &ldquo;Ethiopia shall
yet stretch forth her hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After much excitement the train at last starts, and a mob
accompanied it as far as they can keep up by running, hoping
against hope that you will at length relent and throw them some
money.&nbsp; Once I offered a beggar a new penny, but he handed
it back very gravely, saying &ldquo;No good&mdash;piastre&rdquo;
(meaning that he wanted a piastre); but I pretended to be
offended, and did not give him anything.</p>
<p>Every little station on the road is infested with crowds of
natives hoping for <i>backsheesh</i>, and it is wonderful what
vast numbers of people there are who have nothing to do.&nbsp; At
most stations you will see an ill-favoured fellow with a
goat-skin across his back, filled with water, but I should have
to be very thirsty <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>indeed before I could drink from it.&nbsp; An hour
after leaving Suez we saw our old friend the s.s. Orient in the
Canal close alongside, having taken twenty-four hours to
accomplish this distance.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>At Ismailia we stopped some time, and a lad wanted to clean my
boots which, however, did not require cleaning, so I told him to
black the bare feet of a brown boy who was standing by.&nbsp;
This he proceeded to do in the presence of a crowd of grinning
spectators of all colours&mdash;yellow, brown, coffee-coloured,
and jet black.&nbsp; The lad whose feet were blacked seemed to
enjoy the fun very much, and when it was over appeared to think
he was entitled to a half piastre as well as the operator, so he
got it.&nbsp; The shoeblack then brought an ebony Nubian, whose
skin was already a shining black.&nbsp; He asked me if he might
do his feet, but I made him understand it was quite
unnecessary.&nbsp; A grave-looking Turk observing the proceedings
gave a look which seemed to say, &ldquo;Mad English
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>At
Zagazig we stayed two hours for luncheon, and were much
interested with the infinite variety of costume and feature among
the crowds thronging the station.&nbsp; About half an hour before
reaching Cairo, on looking through the window, we had our first
view of the Pyramids.&nbsp; On our arrival at Cairo we were
greeted with a chorus of the usual kind, but having
&ldquo;wired&rdquo; to the hotel a porter was awaiting us with an
omnibus, and we were soon comfortably located in the new Grand
Hotel.</p>
<p>A walk to the Nile Bridge gave us a good view of the
river.&nbsp; The road to the Pyramids passes for some distance
through a fine avenue of trees, and the river having encroached
on the soil too near to the roots, we saw for the first time a
phase of Egyptian life which is not pleasant&mdash;viz., forced
labour.&nbsp; About 1,500 men were engaged in piling up earth
against the roots, forming a thick, deep embankment against the
river.&nbsp; The soil is carried in baskets, and from the
elevation where we stood the men looked like a swarm of
ants.&nbsp; These men are provided by the Sheiks of the villages
on the demand of the Government, who pay nothing whatever for the
labour.&nbsp; The men receive neither wages nor food, but each
village looks after the families of its absentees, and attends to
their work until their return.&nbsp; The men certainly seemed to
labour with a will.</p>
<p>The Nile begins to rise about the end of June, reaching its
greatest height about the end of September, continuing for about
fifteen days at twenty-four feet above low-water level.&nbsp; If
the rise be thirty feet great damage is done, and if it fail to
reach eighteen feet famine ensues.</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>We
rode for some distance along the valley of the Nile, which varies
from two to twelve miles in width.&nbsp; It is very fertile, the
soil being more than forty feet deep.&nbsp; It is only needful to
sow the seed immediately after the inundation, and in about four
months the harvest is ready to be gathered.&nbsp; The plough in
use is a very primitive article; but the looseness of the soil
renders stronger ploughs unnecessary.&nbsp; In many places as we
went along we saw the natives irrigating by means of the bucket
and pole, with a counterbalance at the end (<i>shadouf</i>),
raising water from the Nile and sending it along the channels
over the fields.&nbsp; In one field we saw agriculture being
carried on as Adam would have done before the Fall, had it been
necessary, the men being quite naked, and digging the earth with
their hands.</p>
<p>Returning to the city we took a walk through old Cairo, along
the narrow streets, passing many little workshops where various
trades were being carried on, the owners appearing pleased at our
noticing them at work.&nbsp; In one place some men were grinding
beans with a huge pestle and mortar, and showed us some of the
meal.&nbsp; In a secluded corner we saw about a dozen old fellows
in every variety of costume sitting on the ground listening to a
very animated story being told by one of the party.&nbsp; They
appeared to be greatly interested, every now and then lifting up
their hands in amazement.&nbsp; These professional story-tellers
are a great institution in Cairo.</p>
<p>Passing down one of the narrow streets our attention was
arrested by the busy hum of children&rsquo;s&rsquo; voices, which
we found proceeded from an upper room, <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>the
casement of which was open.&nbsp; Our guide told us it was a
school, and that the children were repeating passages from the
Koran.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>One of our party, who had not forgotten the pranks of his
boyhood, threw a number of new threepenny pieces into the midst
of the boys, causing great excitement and confusion.&nbsp;
Presently an old man, with a fringe of white hair <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>encircling
his dark face, and wearing a huge pair of brass-framed
spectacles, appeared at the open window brandishing his cane at
us, but in a moment his whole attitude changed, and holding out
his hand he uttered the familiar cry
of&mdash;<i>backsheesh</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p190.jpg">
<img alt=
"A &ldquo;Peep&rdquo;"

</a></p>
<p>Our walk took us through one of the bazaars, which consist of
very narrow lanes full of shops, with dealers in every variety of
goods, most of which are made in the open.&nbsp; We were
particularly struck with the beautiful embroideries of gold and
silver thread, and the expeditious way in which the workmen
executed the various designs.&nbsp; All were very anxious we
should buy, and I overheard one old rascal offer our Coptic guide
ten per cent. commission on our purchases.&nbsp; We, however,
made none.&nbsp; In passing the carpet bazaar we saw an English
party buying dingy carpets.</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>The
most interesting part of our day&rsquo;s experiences was spent in
the manufacturing quarter.&nbsp; There are no large factories in
Cairo, and I question if more than half a dozen people are
employed at any one place.&nbsp; The work is carried on in the
most primitive fashion in the little shops facing the street.</p>

</a></p>
<p>There can be but few secrets in the various trades, as the
workshops are all shallow, and open to the streets.&nbsp; All the
jewellers are in one street about 8ft. in width, each of them
being provided with a safe, obviously of English
manufacture.&nbsp; I do not think, however, that the bellows used
by them were made in Birmingham, for it was curious to note that
they had no valves.&nbsp; At the end of the jewellers&rsquo;
street sits an old fellow like Abraham or Isaac, weighing
precious metals in a pair of evidently very accurate
scales.&nbsp; This man acted <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>as general weigher for the trade,
and his operations were carried on in the face of the
public.&nbsp; Leaving the bazaars we met a crowd of natives
gesticulating, shouting, and frolicking in a very excited
manner.&nbsp; Standing aside to allow the throng to pass, we
found it was a bridal procession conducting a bride to her
husband&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; A few tattered minstrels walked in
front, making a hideous noise on pipes and drums, while a gang of
young men jumped and danced about, and indulged in the wildest
horse-play.&nbsp; The women were ornamented with strips of gilt
paper and coloured ribbons, and had their cheeks thickly coated
with rouge.&nbsp; The bride walked under a canopy consisting of
four poles covered with canvas and was quite enclosed.&nbsp;
Sometimes this portable tent would collapse upon the fair one,
whose struggles were prominently manifested by bulges in the
canvas.&nbsp; The whole party seemed to be making the most of the
occasion.</p>
<p>We next visited the mosque of Sultan Hassan, which was built
in the 14th century, at a cost of &pound;600 per day for the
three years it took to complete.&nbsp; It is the finest mosque in
Cairo.&nbsp; While standing beside the Sultan&rsquo;s tomb within
the mosque our guide related its history.&nbsp; He said that for
three years the Sultan had been absent from Egypt on pilgrimages,
and that during his absence his Grand Vizier declared himself
Sultan.&nbsp; Hassan hearing of this returned to Cairo in the
disguise of a poor pilgrim, and finding that he had still many
adherents he consulted with some of the principal of them as to
the best way of regaining his rights.&nbsp; He first obtained
permission to build this mosque, and <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>when it was finished his partisans
assembled in the building in large numbers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page194"></a><span

</a></p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Hassan, still in the pilgrim&rsquo;s habit, rose to
preach to the people&mdash;this was the preconcerted signal for a
general massacre of the usurper and his supporters; and thus
Hassan recovered his throne.&nbsp; At the entrance to the mosque
our boots were covered with sandals, so that our feet might not
touch the holy floor; but custom does not demand the removal of
the hat.&nbsp; In the court-yard is a fountain where the faithful
perform their ablutions before prayer.&nbsp; In front of the
niche looking towards Mecca were about a dozen persons at their
devotions.&nbsp; Just in advance of them stood a mollah or
priest, and as he bowed his head or kneeled they did the same,
concluding with chanting or singing a prayer.&nbsp; Whilst we
were looking around a little boy was following us, keeping a
sharp look out lest our slippers should come off, and if they
showed any signs of coming loose he at once brought up a man to
fasten them.</p>
<p>One of the sights of Cairo is the egg-hatching
establishment.&nbsp; This institution is rendered necessary,
because the hens are too idle to hatch their eggs in this
country, consequently the operation has to be artificially
performed.&nbsp; The people bring their eggs to the hatching
place and receive one chicken for every two eggs.&nbsp; I
observed the Egyptian eggs are very small, due also to the
laziness of the hens, doubtless.</p>
<p>We next visited the citadel and the mosque of Mohammed Ali, a
magnificent pile, built early in this century.&nbsp; In the
courtyard of this place the Mamelukes in 1811 were massacred by
order of Mohammed Ali.&nbsp; <a name="page196"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 196</span>Fearing their power he invited them
to the mosque, and closing the gates slaughtered them all, save
one who escaped by leaping with his horse from the parapet.&nbsp;
The horse was killed, but the rider was uninjured.&nbsp; About
450 persons were here massacred, and 800 in other parts of the
city.&nbsp; The citadel commands a magnificent view of the city
and surrounding country, and every evening large parties of
tourists assemble there to see the sunset.</p>
<p>The excursion to the Pyramids of Gizeh is now much more easily
made since Isma&iuml;l completed the carriage road by way of
compliment to our Royal Princes on their visit.&nbsp; Our party
was conveyed in carriages, while donkeys had been previously sent
forward for the use of the ladies.&nbsp; While on the
carriage-road the view of the Pyramids is altogether lost till
within a mile of the end of the journey, acacias having been
thickly planted on either side of the road.&nbsp; On leaving the
carriages we were at once surrounded by beggars, who continued to
infest us all the time we were in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; Some
were loud, almost menacing in their demands, others soft and
insinuating.&nbsp; One kind, which I call the &ldquo;quiet
devil&rdquo; or &ldquo;familiar,&rdquo; creeps by your side, and
whispers in your ear confidentially that he is &ldquo;a good
man&rdquo;; that the others are &ldquo;bad men&rdquo;; that he
will not bother you for anything; that you are &ldquo;a good
man&rdquo;; that he will &ldquo;help you, and keep off the
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; But alas! he too is sure to whisper in
conclusion <i>backsheesh</i>.&nbsp; If the road is a little rough
these &ldquo;good men&rdquo; seem to fancy you cannot get on
without help, so one on each side puts a hand under your arm and
half carries you along.&nbsp; It is quite useless to <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>protest;
they look at you as though they would say, &ldquo;poor man! he
thinks he can walk by himself; but we know better; he would fall
at once did we not hold him up.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, when we
reach level ground again, there is a universal chorus
of&mdash;<i>&rsquo;sheesh</i>, <i>backsheesh</i>.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On arriving at the little house at the foot of the Pyramids
our guide Abaid summoned the Sheik of the village, who proceeded
to detail two men for each person who intended to make the
ascent&mdash;ladies and fat men being allotted four men each to
help them up.&nbsp; The weather being extremely hot my sister and
I were content to see the rest of the party make the ascent while
we sat in a shady place at the base.&nbsp; A group of twenty
Arabs of the most patriarchal aspect squatted on the ground in
front of us in a half-circle; immediately our eyes fell upon any
one of them he mutely extended one hand&mdash;not so much to help
us as to be helped&mdash;instantly lowering it without complaint
on our looking elsewhere.&nbsp; This would become
monotonous.&nbsp; I would occasionally show by my look that I was
annoyed, upon which the beggar would get a crack over his head
from one of his neighbours.</p>
<p>The Great Pyramid of Cheops is 732ft. along the base line and
460ft. high, covering an area of 536,000 square feet&mdash;about
equal in extent to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields in London.&nbsp;
Its height is about 60ft. higher than the cross on St.
Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.&nbsp; My wife managed the ascent very
well, and also went with the rest to explore the interior, and
all seemed greatly pleased with their exploits.&nbsp; A fee of
two francs to the Sheik and a franc a piece to the helpers is the
regular charge for each <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>person; but even the Sheik is not
above taking a little extra by way of <i>backsheesh</i>.&nbsp;
Our party were quite ready for their lunch, which Abaid quickly
spread out in the little house provided by the Government for the
accommodation of visitors.&nbsp; We were shown into a large room,
and while at table the doorways were filled with a hungry crowd,
quarrelling, laughing, and jostling each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Some of the bolder spirits at length got into the room, but
our guide seizing his stick administered two or three heavy
blows, and soon cleared them out.&nbsp; It was wonderful to see
how tamely big men will allow themselves to be driven.&nbsp;
Truly the stick is a great institution in Egypt, although perhaps
none but the ruling class would acquiesce in the inscription
found in one of the ancient tombs to the effect that &ldquo;The
stick came down from heaven&mdash;a blessing from God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>Before sitting down to eat, a boy brought water that we
might wash our hands.&nbsp; The mode was certainly
primitive.&nbsp; We had to hold our hands out of the window while
he poured water over them.&nbsp; A noisy crowd of Arabs were
sitting under another window, and a barber in the midst was
operating upon the head of one of them, and it was really
wonderful how cleverly he shaved, making a clean sweep of every
lock and every hair.&nbsp; I asked Abaid if the men were under a
vow, but he said it was because summer was coming on, and it
would be cooler without hair.</p>

</a></p>
<p>After a scene of great confusion in paying the various
claimants, during which the Sheik had to make a vigorous use of
his long stick, we started to see the Sphinx, which is about 500
yards off.&nbsp; Before leaving, <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>I called the Sheik and gave him two
francs, that he might instruct his men to keep the mob from
us.&nbsp; This he accepted with great solemnity, and in parting
shook hands in a most impressive manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=
"A Wash and a Shave"

</a></p>
<p>The Sphinx is cut out of the solid rock, and is about thirty
feet from the top of the head to the bottom of the chin, and
about fourteen feet across the face, the body being 140 feet
long.&nbsp; I could see no beauty in the face, the features being
almost obliterated.</p>
<p>Near the Sphinx is a fine underground temple formed of immense
granite blocks and polished alabaster.&nbsp; The pavement is of
granite and is perfectly smooth.&nbsp; Some of the finest statues
at B&ucirc;lak were found in a well adjoining this temple.</p>
<p>Leaving our hotel at seven a.m., we started for Gizeh station
<i>en route</i> for Sakkara, the railway taking us as far as
Bedrash&ecirc;n.&nbsp; We had engaged eleven donkeys for carrying
our party and the food necessary for the whole day&rsquo;s
refreshment.&nbsp; The confusion at Gizeh station in obtaining
our tickets and getting the donkeys into the train was something
tremendous.&nbsp; Fortunately, the morning was rather cool.</p>
<p>On arriving at Bedrash&ecirc;n we had some difficulty in
finding the right donkeys, and I had great misgivings about the
prospective five hours&rsquo; ride; but at last we got fairly
off, and by degrees my confidence returned.&nbsp; We soon reached
M&icirc;trah&icirc;neh, the site of ancient Memphis, now only
marked by a vast number of heaps and mounds of rubbish, under
which are doubtless buried many treasures of ancient Egyptian
art.&nbsp; A number of articles which have been recently dug out
were shown <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>in a rude enclosure; one or two of the statues
beautifully executed.&nbsp; Lying in a pool, face downwards, is a
statue of Ramses II. belonging to the British Museum, but the
authorities of that institution have not yet taken the trouble to
remove it.&nbsp; The statue is 50ft. long, and is of siliceous
limestone, very hard, and bearing a high polish.&nbsp; In one
hand the figure holds a scroll bearing his name, and at his side
is his little daughter, reaching to his knee.&nbsp; The face is
still quite smooth, the features are sharply cut and delicately
finished, and the expression perfectly preserved, looking really
beautiful.&nbsp; Memphis was said by Herodotus to extend for six
miles.&nbsp; It was conquered in turns by Persians, Assyrians,
and Romans, each of whom did their share towards ruining it, and
when at last the Mohammedans conquered the country, its doom was
sealed, and the stones of its palace and temples taken away to
build the new city of Cairo.&nbsp; The dykes being no longer kept
in repair, the overflow of the Nile gradually piled up the mud
year by year, and this, with the sand from the desert, has, in
the course of ages, made Memphis little more than a name.&nbsp;
Memphis is called in the Bible <i>Noph</i>, and in the time of
the Patriarchs was the capital of Lower Egypt; but the prophecy
of Jeremiah, xlvi. 19, has been literally fulfilled: &ldquo;Noph
shall be waste and desolate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Memphis we go on to Sakkara, for thousands of years
the ancient Necropolis or burying-ground.&nbsp; In the centre
stands the great Step Pyramid, built in steps of comparatively
small pieces of stone.&nbsp; It is said to be not only the oldest
pyramid, but also the most ancient monument of any kind in the
world.&nbsp; The cemetery <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>is four and a half miles long by an
average of three-fourths of a mile in width, and being full of
holes it is necessary to be very careful in crossing it.&nbsp;
The ground is strewed with skulls and other human bones, some of
the former being of great thickness.&nbsp; Soon we reached the
house of Mariette Bey, built for his use when he was engaged in
his explorations, and here, by his permission, parties are at
liberty to rest and take their lunch.</p>
<p>The first object of interest is the Serapeum, or Apis
Mausoleum.&nbsp; When alive, the sacred bull was worshipped in a
splendid temple at Memphis, and lodged in an adjoining
palace.&nbsp; When dead he was buried in this mausoleum, in a
vault excavated out of the solid rock, his body being placed in a
huge sarcophagus hewn out of a single piece of granite, and
hollowed into a regular square to receive the body.&nbsp; A
cover, also of granite, and weighing many tons, was then placed
over it.&nbsp; The size of the sarcophagus is 13ft. long, 7ft.
6in. wide, and 11ft. high.</p>
<p>This mausoleum had for ages been known to exist somewhere, but
no one knew the locality.&nbsp; The ancient Strabo wrote,
&ldquo;There is also a serapeum in a very sandy spot where drifts
of sand are raised by the wind to such a degree that we saw some
sphinxes buried up to their heads, and others half
covered.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mariette, recollecting this passage,
observed in 1860 a sphinx&rsquo;s head appearing through the
sand, and it at once occurred to him that this must be the site
of the avenue of which mention is made by another ancient writer,
so he commenced a clearing and laid bare 141 sphinxes.&nbsp; To
do this he had to make a cutting in the <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>sand 70ft.
deep; but at length he was rewarded by discovering the entrance
to the mausoleum.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p204.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>There are several galleries for the different dynasties, but
only one is now shown, the interments in which date from 650
<span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span> down to 50 <span
class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>&nbsp; The galleries extend for 400
yards, and there are now twenty-four sarcophagi in their
places.&nbsp; Three of these are beautifully sculptured.&nbsp;
One of them is of polished granite, and although the engraving is
only 1/16 in. deep, a mere scratch in the polish, it is as clear
as when first done, over 2,000 years ago, and so perfect is the
stone that it rings like a bell when struck.</p>
<p>From the Serapeum we proceeded to examine one of the tombs,
also excavated by Mariette Bey.&nbsp; It is called <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>the Tomb of
Tih.&nbsp; Over the doorways of these ancient tombs it was the
custom to inscribe the name and titles of the deceased, and also
an invocation to the God of Tombs (the tomb having been built
during life by the person himself), with these
objects:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&mdash;To accord to deceased propitious funeral-rites, and
a good burial-place after a long and happy life.</p>
<p>2nd.&mdash;To be favourably disposed to deceased in his
journey beyond the tomb.</p>
<p>3rd.&mdash;To secure to him, to all eternity, the proper
payment of funeral-offerings by his relations.</p>
<p>A list of these offerings is carved upon the walls, which are
covered with sculptures representing the scenes in which the
deceased had been engaged during life, ending with a
representation of the conveyance of the mummy to the tomb.&nbsp;
The tomb itself contains several apartments, in which the
relatives met upon certain anniversaries to present
votive-offerings, etc.</p>
<p>We were astonished to see the perfect state of preservation in
which the tomb remains.&nbsp; The sculptures on the walls are as
sharp and clear and the colours apparently as bright as when laid
on.&nbsp; Sand is a good preservative when not in motion, and to
this must the marvel be ascribed.&nbsp; Over the door is the
inscription giving Tih&rsquo;s name, and stating that he was a
priest; and on the walls of the first chamber are representations
showing statues of Tih being embarked in boats and oxen being
brought for sacrifice, one of them being offered up.&nbsp; There
is another showing Tih with his wife and family watching his
people at work in the farmyard.&nbsp; Some of them are <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>bringing
sacks of grain for the poultry; others are fattening the birds by
making and forcing pellets of flour down their throats.&nbsp;
Behind this there is a view of the farm-buildings, the roofs
being supported on carved wooden pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>In the middle there is a pool where ducks are swimming, while
cattle are seen pasturing in the fields around.&nbsp; Among the
birds Tih kept are cranes and pigeons, ducks and geese.&nbsp; He
had also cattle of every size and kind, including antelopes,
gazelles, and wild goats.&nbsp; Then come the boats filled with
jars and bales transporting farm produce down the Nile.&nbsp; In
another place men are shown carrying fruits and vegetables, and
pigeons in cages.&nbsp; Farther on are seen men drawing statues
enclosed in temples of wood, half-a-dozen dragging with ropes,
while one pours water on the road to make it easier.&nbsp; In
another room Till is shown as a sportsman in a boat; in one hand
he holds a decoy-bird, while with the other he hurls a curved
stick like an Australian boomerang.&nbsp; In the water are seen
crocodiles and hippopotami: a crocodile and hippopotamus are
fighting, the latter being evidently victorious; some of the
servants are trying <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>to catch them, and the hippopotamus
is just being hooked with a sort of harpoon.&nbsp; (This scene
recalls the verse in Job, &ldquo;Canst thou draw out the
leviathan with a hook?&rdquo;)&nbsp; Here again the fish are
being drawn in nets into the boats, while the work of the farm
goes vigorously on.&nbsp; Cows are seen crossing a ford and
browsing in a field, while herdsmen are driving a flock of
goats.&nbsp; Oxen are ploughing just as we saw them in the fields
to-day, and with a very similar plough.&nbsp; The seed is being
sown, corn reaped, and men with three-pronged forks are gathering
it into heaps while the oxen are treading it out.&nbsp; In
another place the corn is being tied into sheaves, and donkeys
are being brought up with much fuss and use of the stick to take
it to the granaries.&nbsp; Some of these scenes are drawn with
inimitable humour.&nbsp; Carpenters are engaged in making
furniture, and shipwrights in building boats, while Tih is always
present directing each operation.</p>
<p>The Egyptians were said by Diodorus to call their houses
hostelries, and their tombs their everlasting homes.</p>
<p>We now remounted our donkeys, and for an hour rode over the
sandy desert through dreadful mud villages, from which all the
population turned out as we passed, crying with all their
might&mdash;<i>&rsquo;sheesh</i>, <i>&rsquo;sheesh</i>,
<i>backsheesh</i>, <i>&rsquo;sheesh</i>,
<i>&rsquo;sheesh</i>.</p>
<p>Passing several strings of camels&mdash;which I described as
&ldquo;camelcades,&rdquo; coining a word for the purpose&mdash;we
soon regained the delightfully fertile country which is watered
by the Nile.&nbsp; For more than two hours we trotted and
galloped along through a very rich country, where hundreds of
acres of date-palms <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>were growing&mdash;where the young
corn was waving, and peas, beans, and cucumbers in great
luxuriance&mdash;no more dust nor sand, but a pleasant breeze and
bright sun, with nothing to mar the pleasure except the sight of
the wretched natives.&nbsp; Most of the children are absolutely
naked, while their parents&rsquo; clothes are of the most limited
description.</p>

<p>We halted for lunch under some palm-trees by a branch of the
Nile, and then proceeded to the carriages, which we had ordered
to meet us in the Gizeh road.&nbsp; Some of us had to ride back
into Cairo on our donkeys, and on our way we passed the Khedive,
who cordially acknowledged our salutation.&nbsp; All our party
agreed in saying that to-day&rsquo;s excursion was one of the
most delightful we had ever had.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p>Friday being the Mohammedan Sabbath we devoted this day to the
Dancing and Howling Dervishes, as they hold their principal
<i>zikr</i> or ceremonial on that day.&nbsp; We first visited the
convent of the dancing Dervishes and witnessed one of their
performances, and certainly a curious spectacle it was. In the
centre of the room a space of about 50ft. in diameter is railed
off, and about twenty solemn-looking men in hats like the tall
&ldquo;tile&rdquo; without brims are sitting opposite the
door.&nbsp; They looked like a lot of ancient
&ldquo;Friends&rdquo; at the head of a meeting.&nbsp; In the
gallery above were some musicians, one of whom was playing a
flute in a melancholy manner, and another reciting a
prayer.&nbsp; At a certain point the Dervishes within the circle
bow and rise, and taking off their outer garments begin walking
round the enclosure with solemn steps and slow, headed by the
Chief Priest or Sheik.&nbsp; On passing the carpet upon which the
Sheik has been sitting they turn and bow, and this is repeated
two or three times; then they go into the middle of the
enclosure, <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>spreading out their garments like ladies in the old
minuet; the music quickens, and they begin to whirl around on one
foot, occasionally touching the ground with the other.&nbsp; The
performers&rsquo; eyes are closed (or appear to be so), but they
keep on in perfect order&mdash;never touching one
another&mdash;while the old Priest walks about among them.&nbsp;
Some of the more experienced Dervishes can revolve fifty or sixty
times a minute, keeping it up for nearly half an hour.&nbsp; It
was a curious proceeding altogether, and, for a wonder, no
<i>backsheesh</i> was demanded, the Priests being supported by
endowments and occasional gifts from the Khedive.&nbsp; Mounting
our donkeys we rode off to the Howling Dervishes, where we found
them in full howl.&nbsp; About twenty of them were engaged in
making the most hideous noise imaginable.&nbsp; These fellows had
their hair very long and shaggy, and threw it about their heads
in the wildest manner.&nbsp; Every time they raise their heads
they utter the word <i>HU</i> (God alone), which sounds like the
yell of a wild beast, at times the excitement rising to such a
height that some of them would foam at the mouth and fall to the
ground apparently in a fit.&nbsp; They wound up their proceedings
with a prolonged howl and a deep grunt.&nbsp; These Dervishes,
like their dancing brethren, are supported by Government
endowment.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that when first instituted these &ldquo;pious
orgies&rdquo; were entered upon with a due sense of solemnity,
and I believe in places remote from the regular tourist route the
religious feeling still predominates, but the Howling and Dancing
Dervishes in Cairo have long since become one of the regular
sights to which foreign visitors are always taken.</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>Upon
the occasion of our visit there were several clergymen present,
more than one artist, and a number of ladies, amongst the latter
being a placid looking Quaker, who, with hands folded before her,
was calmly surveying the &ldquo;creaturely activity&rdquo; of the
Howling enthusiasts.</p>
<p>We afterwards paid a visit to Miss Whateley&rsquo;s Schools,
at the British Mission.&nbsp; There are over 300 native children
here, and we heard many of them read in English and French, and
also do some exercises in translation.&nbsp; The girls were
engaged in embroidering, reading, and writing, and they sang two
hymns in Arabic while we stayed.&nbsp; Then we saw them muster
for the recess, and a bright little fellow stepped out into the
middle of the hall and repeated the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, first in
English and then in Arabic, after which they went out in a most
orderly manner.&nbsp; Miss Whateley seems much encouraged at the
result of her many years&rsquo; labours; but I have no doubt she
has had her times of discouragement.&nbsp; My wife visited an
Arab school in Syria, the superintendent of which told her that
after two years&rsquo; continuous labour amongst the people of
his district, the result was so unsatisfactory that he was
greatly discouraged and was inclined to abandon the
mission.&nbsp; Calling the people together he told them of his
disappointment, and said that although he had worked diligently
amongst them for so long a time, they appeared to be no better
than before, and that he felt that he must leave them.&nbsp; The
people, who had received many benefits from him in various ways,
began to be seriously alarmed, and entreated him to try them yet
again.&nbsp; One man got up in the meeting and said, <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>&ldquo;Teacher, you must not go, you have made us much
better.&nbsp; When you came first there was a woman living near
who used to steal all the fowls in her neighbourhood, but
now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;<i>she only steals the
eggs</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The superintendent&rsquo;s features
somewhat relaxed on hearing this, and the quick-witted Arabs
immediately perceiving their advantage, renewed their appeals, a
woman rising and saying, &ldquo;Teacher, when you came first my
neighbour&rsquo;s son used to thrash his mother every day, but
since he has been at your school he only thrashes her once a
month.&rdquo;&nbsp; The superintendent remained, and is well
satisfied with the progress which has since been made.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we went for a drive in the Shubra Avenue,
which is the Rotten Row of Cairo.&nbsp; The custom is to drive
quickly up one side, returning slowly on the other, the drive
occupying an hour.&nbsp; The Khedive drove past us in his
carriage, preceded by two magnificent fellows (<i>sais</i>) whose
duty it is to run in front of the carriage.&nbsp; They were
dressed in gorgeous gold tissue waistcoats, long white skirts, a
silk sash of many colours round the waist, a fez with long
tassel, legs and feet bare, and in the hand a handsome
staff.&nbsp; These men run quite as fast as the horses, keep up
the pace for a couple of hours, and are employed to clear the
crowded streets for the carriages.&nbsp; This they do by shouting
loudly in a fine resonant voice, which is very effectual.&nbsp;
The avenue was crowded with carriages, some of them containing
ladies of the harem.&nbsp; Their carriages have windows all
round.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Some of the ladies are shrouded as for burial; others leave
only the eyes uncovered, while some (the prettiest, <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>presumably)
wear only thin gauze veils, through which their faces are plainly
to be seen.&nbsp; All wear the same languishing expression, and
appear to be very fond of peeping at the Europeans, and as we
passed and repassed them they would recognise us with a smile,
and then, to save appearances, turn away.&nbsp; When we passed
the guard-house the soldiers turned out, thinking it was the
Khedive&rsquo;s carriage, and drew up in saluting order.</p>

</a></p>
<p>They were greatly disgusted on discovering their
mistake.&nbsp; At four o&rsquo;clock a general stampede of
carriages, horsemen, runners, and pedestrians takes place, and
the road is soon quite deserted.</p>
<p>One of the features of Cairene life is the universal use of
donkeys by all classes of the people; ancient women shrouded from
head to foot in black gauze, old men with long grey beards, and
noses not much <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>shorter&mdash;their heads wrapped in turbans, and robes
covering the donkeys&rsquo; backs&mdash;jogging along, rubbing
against the British tourist, the latter looking anything but
grave and serious on his Jerusalem pony.&nbsp; Our party
certainly did not look more <i>bizarre</i> than others; but we
should not feel inclined to enter Birmingham in the same state as
we often entered and left Cairo.</p>

</a></p>
<p>One morning we got up early for a donkey-ride across the Nile
to see, amongst other things, the garden and farm produce arrive
from the country round.&nbsp; Crossing the Nile we turned down a
fine avenue of sycamores, two or three miles long.&nbsp; The
Khedive&rsquo;s gardens lie on one side and the river at the
other.&nbsp; Moored to the river bank was an Englishman&rsquo;s
<i>dahabieh</i> <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>or Nile boat.&nbsp; A party had just returned from the
cataracts, and on the upper deck we observed a dead
crocodile.&nbsp; Riding by one palace towards another, we passed
a crowd of people on their way to market, with bullocks, goats,
camels laden with clover, women with the round cakes so common
here, and a great variety of other things.&nbsp; Presently we
sighted the Pyramids, one side lit up with the morning sun, while
another was in deep shadow.&nbsp; The Sphinx was also plainly to
be seen.</p>
<p>Leaving the Gizeh Road leading to the Pyramids we turned
towards Cairo, our donkeys instantly knowing that we were
homeward-bound, and needing no persuasion to gallop back to
breakfast.&nbsp; On nearing the bridge we came upon hosts of
camels, donkeys, and oxen laden with produce, and being assessed
for the octroi or town-tax.&nbsp; The police were armed with long
spikes, which they pushed into the load to ascertain if anything
else was packed inside.&nbsp; It was an interesting
scene&mdash;the busy crowd, the magnificent river, and the
brilliant morning sunshine making up a picture not easily
forgotten.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting drives in the neighbourhood of
Cairo is to Heliopolis&mdash;part of the way lying through a fine
avenue of acacias&mdash;and passing the old camping ground used
as a <i>rendezvous</i> by the Mecca pilgrims.&nbsp; It is the old
caravan road, and stretches far away into the desert, from which
came to us a delightfully fresh breeze.&nbsp; We also passed the
Abbaseyeh Palace, built by Abbas Pasha, who, fearing
assassination, lived here in seclusion, keeping sentinels on the
towers to give warning of the approach of a mob, and <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>dromedaries
and fleet horses always ready saddled for escape into the
desert.&nbsp; He was, however, murdered at last in spite of all
his precautions.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Along the road are some beautiful plantations of palms,
oranges, and lemons, castor-oil and other plants growing in the
greatest luxuriance.&nbsp; Heaps of oranges were lying on the
ground.&nbsp; After driving through a fine olive plantation we
came out upon an extensive plain, where, in 1517, Sultan Selim
defeated the last of the Mameluke Dynasty, and made Egypt a
Turkish province.&nbsp; Here too, in 1800, the French defeated
the Turks and regained possession of Cairo.&nbsp; Our guide
called a halt in order to show us a fine old sycamore, called the
virgin&rsquo;s tree, under which Joseph and Mary are said to have
rested during their flight into Egypt.&nbsp; I asked Abaid if he
believed the story.&nbsp; Placing his hand upon his heart and
bowing his head, he replied, with something of the
sententiousness of a Dr. Johnson, &ldquo;Sir, I am a
Christian!&rdquo;&nbsp; I felt inclined to tell him that I also
was a Christian, but that I did not believe it; but then why
should I disturb his honest belief?&nbsp; Soon the obelisk of
Heliopolis came in view, and we knew we were near it by the crowd
of youngsters swarming round the carriage.&nbsp; But I adopted my
old plan of being the first to ask for <i>backsheesh</i>, causing
them to laugh so heartily that they could hardly take up the
cry.</p>
<p>The obelisk is about 6ft. square at the base and about 68ft.
high; it is the oldest in Egypt, and was erected by the founder
of the twelfth dynasty.&nbsp; The inscriptions on its four sides
give its history and the account of its erection about 3,000
<span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span></p>

<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>Heliopolis was called Bethshemish by the Jews, and in
Exodus is called ON.&nbsp; It was here that Joseph married
Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, and where Moses became
learned in the wisdom of the Egyptians.&nbsp; Here Plato and
Herodotus studied, and Josephus says&mdash;&ldquo;The city was
given to the Children of Israel as their residence when they came
down into Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp; The obelisk, as we see it, was old
when Abraham came into the country; but, notwithstanding its
venerable age and intensely interesting associations, it has not
been too sacred for tourists who have been caught chipping pieces
off the edges.</p>
<p>After lunch we drove to B&ucirc;lak, an interesting suburb of
Cairo.&nbsp; The houses are very old, and the street-scenes very
curious and thoroughly Eastern in character.&nbsp; The large
overhanging windows and casements familiar in pictures are
everywhere to be seen, and now and then a glimpse of a female
face is caught peeping furtively out at the passers-by.&nbsp; The
streets are very narrow, and the coachman yells and shouts at the
foot-passengers in his way, not scrupling to apply the whip to
quicken their movements.&nbsp; All this is taken
patiently&mdash;far too much so&mdash;and betrays the saddest
side of Egyptian character, speaking volumes for the way in which
the people have been treated.</p>
<p>Hard by was a curious sight.&nbsp; Standing against a wall,
and raised above the level of the street like another Simon
Stylites, was a strange-looking man, whose only raiment consisted
of a sack, through a hole in which one arm was thrust.&nbsp; In
his hand he held a small instrument like a garden-rake, with
which he tortured his back, while his gaze &ldquo;seemed upon the
<a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>future
bent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some irreverent tourists looking on were
presently moved to laughter at the peculiar exhibition, upon
which the holy man gave them one glance of wonder and pity, and
then resumed his gaze into futurity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>It being fair-day, there were a large number of booths, cheap
theatres, peep-shows, merry-go-rounds, etc., just as one sees in
England.&nbsp; In another place was a story-teller, surrounded by
an appreciative audience, who treated every &ldquo;point&rdquo;
with loud laughter.&nbsp; It was curious to see how earnest and
interested they all were, and the dramatic manner in which the
story was told.</p>
<p>The National Museum for Egyptian antiquities, founded by
Mariette Bey, is situated in B&ucirc;lak.&nbsp; Our time being
short, we proposed paying it another visit, which, however, we
were unfortunately unable to do.&nbsp; Much of the sculpture is
really marvellous in its life-like character.&nbsp; One of the
most remarkable statues is of wood, and is said to be 4,000 years
old.&nbsp; It is admirably carved.&nbsp; There is also a large
collection of jewellery, beads, enamels, etc.; chess and
draughtboards, an artist&rsquo;s paint-box and brushes, bread,
eggs, fruit, pieces of well-made rope and thread; an axe of gilt
bronze, having a gilt cedar-wood handle; a gold boat with twelve
silver oarsmen, and many other curiosities.&nbsp; The museum is
one of the most interesting sights in Egypt, and will well repay
many visits.</p>
<p>In the evening some of our party took donkeys and a guide and
returned to B&ucirc;lak to see some of the shows, but the first
they visited was of so extraordinary a character they decided to
see no more until their taste was educated up or down to the
present Egyptian standard.</p>
<p><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>The
railway journey from Cairo to Alexandria occupied about 6&frac12;
hours.&nbsp; The line crosses the Delta of the Nile, the country
being very flat all the way.</p>
<p>The soil here is extremely fertile, and it was very
interesting to watch the various agricultural operations as we
rode along.&nbsp; We particularly noticed the many modes in which
water is supplied to the land.&nbsp; Alongside the railway runs a
stream issuing from the Nile, and the different holdings of land
are bordered with little streamlets in place of hedges.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p223.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>At the junction of these streamlets with the main stream may
frequently be seen a couple of men standing on either bank
lifting water from the river to the streamlets by means of a huge
flat bowl, holding probably eight to ten gallons.&nbsp; This
vessel is lifted on either side by means of two long handles
diverging from each other, and it is surprising how large a
quantity of water can be thrown up by means of it <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>in an
hour.&nbsp; The bowl is always in motion with a fine swing, and
it is evident the men are working on their own account.</p>
<p>Every station at which we stopped is crowded with people
selling oranges, water, etc., and very clever they are at their
business too, very persuasive, and as quick as thought to see if
you are inclined to buy.&nbsp; The children are the merriest,
liveliest things imaginable, with bright eyes and shining white
teeth.&nbsp; Here also may be seen numbers of beggars, young and
old, calling out eternal <i>backsheesh</i>.&nbsp; We saw some
venerable old fellows, bent nearly double with age, and with hair
and whiskers quite white, who entreated us piteously to help
them, saying &ldquo;Got no mother, got no father,
<i>backsheesh</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such orphans as these never
obtained our sympathy, although they afforded us great
amusement.</p>
<p>While in Cairo, news came of the dissolution of Parliament by
Lord Beaconsfield, and we hastened to Alexandria to take the
steamer for Italy on the following day; but on arriving we found
the weather so excessively rough that the steamers were detained:
and, as there seemed no prospect of getting off, we determined to
proceed to Port Sa&iuml;d, by way of Ismail&iuml;a, in order to
take the steamer sailing thence for Naples, hoping on some future
occasion to be able to see what is to be seen in
Alexandria.&nbsp; A day&rsquo;s railway-ride brought us to
Ismail&iuml;a, from which place we took the evening mail-boat to
Port Sa&iuml;d.&nbsp; The night was very cold, and after a seven
hours&rsquo; trip on the Canal it was very pleasant to find
ourselves in the magnificent hotel built by Prince Henry of the
Netherlands, attached to the Dutch factory at Port Sa&iuml;d.</p>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>One
of the Orient Steamers was due to sail on the following day, and
we expected to proceed to Naples in her, but after providing us
with tickets the agent sent us word that she had been detained a
week and that we must choose another vessel.&nbsp; There was no
other way of escape than by taking the P. and O. Steamer
&ldquo;Mongolia&rdquo; to Malta, trusting to being able to find a
ready means of crossing to Naples from that place.&nbsp;
Unfortunately a heavy storm in the Mediterranean had the effect
of delaying our arrival in Malta some hours, and we had the
mortification of seeing the Naples steamer leaving the harbour as
we were entering it.&nbsp; We arrived on Monday and found there
would not be another steamer until Thursday, and as the
Birmingham election was to take place on Wednesday in the
following week our chance of getting there seemed very
doubtful.&nbsp; Leaving Malta, however, on the Thursday, by dint
of almost continual travelling night and day, we arrived safely
in Birmingham at half-past ten on the Wednesday morning, and
proceeded at once to register our votes for Bright and
Chamberlain, two of the three successful Liberal candidates.</p>

<p>After a stormy passage through the Mediterranean we turned in
towards Port Sa&iuml;d, and soon after sighting the handsome
lighthouse took the French pilot on board, anchoring broadside on
to the main street of the town and within fifty yards of the
shore.&nbsp; A motley throng, in boats quite as motley soon
filled up the space between the ship and the shore, and a wild
jabber composed of a mixture of English, French, Italian, and
Arabic filled the air.&nbsp; Presently the usual tribe of pedlars
came on deck, and having spread out their wares invited the
passengers to buy, somewhat after the fashion of London tradesmen
in Cheapside hundreds of years ago with their cry of &ldquo;What
lack ye?&rdquo;&nbsp; The inevitable Maltese with his lace, the
Greek money-changer walking about with his hands full of silver
offering to change, and astonishing the honest Britisher <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>on his
first voyage by his liberality in proffering twenty shillings for
a sovereign&mdash;the rate of exchange, however, leaving him a
very good profit.&nbsp; Near him is a Hebrew, whom I remember
having seen at Aden, the black curls over his brow reminding one
forcibly of Benjamin Disraeli.&nbsp; This man keeps to his trade
of dealer in ostrich feathers.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Here also are gentlemen of the long robe&mdash;not lawyers,
but Arabs, in ample white night-shirts and turbans&mdash;offering
to young ladies in the most seductive tones, at two shillings
each, coral necklaces, which can be purchased in Birmingham at
three shillings the dozen, while dealers in photographs, melons,
and oranges walk about always ready to take one-fourth of what
they ask for their wares.&nbsp; Parallel with us are the quays,
on which are crowds of people of all nationalities.&nbsp; The
Custom House in front is occupied by a company of English
artillerymen, the entrance being guarded by a British sentry,
while overhead the Egyptian flag is flying.&nbsp; Away to the
left is the old Dutch hotel, <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>recently bought by the British
Government, and now occupied by two hundred men of the Royal
Marine Light Infantry.</p>
<p>Immediately in front of the ship is the main street of the
town.&nbsp; It is perfectly straight and about half a mile long,
with a small public garden near the end.&nbsp; In this street are
a large number of <i>casinos</i>, where music is dealt out at
nights by bands of female performers, who are called
&ldquo;Bohemiennes,&rdquo; and where, we are assured, everything
is properly respectable&mdash;until eleven o&rsquo;clock!&nbsp;
Many of our lady passengers, in the innocence of their hearts,
looking forward to a pleasant concert during the evening, are
much shocked when they learn that the said concerts are held in
<i>casinos</i>.</p>
<p>We landed at ten o&rsquo;clock, and had a leisurely walk
through the town and halfway through the Arab quarter, but the
smells were so offensive that we turned back.&nbsp; A lot of
young Arabs, however, urged us to go on farther, for there was an
Arab hanging, but as we did not think a dead Arab would be likely
to be a more agreeable sight than a living one we declined.&nbsp;
The culprit had been executed that morning for the murder of his
grand-daughter, nine months previously.&nbsp; An account of his
crime was written in Arabic and attached to his breast, and the
large scissors with which he committed the murder were suspended
around his neck.&nbsp; Some of the young Arabs were vexed with us
because we would not give them <i>backsheesh</i>, and began to be
insulting, talking about Arabi, when presently a smart youth of
ten years old interfered, and, cuffing the ears of the young
monkeys, loudly proclaimed the prowess of the British.</p>
<p><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>We
went to look at the Dutch House where the Marines were quartered,
and a young officer, Lieutenant Cotter, kindly asked us to go
over the building.&nbsp; The rooms are very fine; but what a
change in the scene since we slept here for a night two-and-half
years ago!&nbsp; Then the hotel was in operation, and the rooms
were furnished as elaborately as in the house of an English
gentleman.&nbsp; But everything had been taken away, and the
officers were sleeping on the marble floors, and the men on the
floors of the adjoining warehouses, where also the horses were
stabled.&nbsp; Lieutenant Cotter had made a bedstead for himself,
and one of his men had made him a bath, and these, with a chair,
completed the furnishing of his room; his wash-basin consisted of
a large flower-pot, with a cork in the hole at the bottom.&nbsp;
The Marines arrived in Egypt a few days after Tel-el-Kebir, and
so saw no fighting; but they had to march over to Fort Gemileh,
seven miles away, and fully expected a very severe fight, as the
fort is heavily armed with modern guns, and was manned by
Nubians, who are reported to be excellent soldiers.&nbsp;
Fortunately, however, there was no need to fight, as the
commander recognised that the war was over.</p>
<p>At night a number of our passengers, of all classes, went
ashore to attend the concert, and one of them known as Cetewayo,
<i>alias</i> the Carrib or the Pirate King, announced his
intention of kicking up a great row at the <i>casino</i> (of
course <i>after</i> eleven o&rsquo;clock), and he was as good as
his word, and others besides, several having to be locked up for
the night.&nbsp; We visited the soldiers in the barracks, and <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>they were
very glad to have a chat.&nbsp; We sent them the newspapers we
had brought from England; with which they were greatly
pleased.&nbsp; They told us the numbers, variety, and voracity of
the insects was something maddening; some being busy at night,
and others during the day, and that it was almost impossible to
keep oneself decent.&nbsp; Altogether Port Sa&iuml;d must be a
dreadful place for Englishmen to live in; there was very little
society, and I was told that at the time there was only one
unmarried lady left.</p>
<p>The commanding officer of the Marines told us that the
principal duty they had to perform as &ldquo;police&rdquo; was to
keep the English sailors and visitors in order, almost all the
drunkenness and trouble coming from them&mdash;to our disgrace be
it said.</p>
<p>The land all along the coast lies very low, and is not seen
until the yellowish-green water near it is reached.&nbsp; The
water is discoloured by the mud of the Nile, one of the mouths of
which (the Tanitic) is situated a little to the west of Port
Sa&iuml;d.&nbsp; This ceaseless flow of mud was one of the
greatest difficulties experienced in making the Canal, and
necessitated important and expensive works to prevent its access
to the harbour.&nbsp; Lake Menzaleh is formed by this Nile mouth,
and covers an area of about 1,000 square miles.&nbsp; Good
wildfowl shooting is to be had there, and there are numbers of
flamingos and other birds.&nbsp; Port Sa&iuml;d, as is well
known, owes its origin to the Canal, and is situated on an island
separating Lake Menzaleh from the Mediterranean.&nbsp; The town
was expected by M. de Lesseps to progress very
rapidly&mdash;indeed to rival Alexandria, but it has not gone
ahead so fast as he <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>expected.&nbsp; At present there are
about 12,000 people there, and I should say more than half are
Europeans.&nbsp; The town is built very regularly, and consists
of rather temporary brick and wooden houses.&nbsp; The making of
the harbour was a very difficult work.&nbsp; It occupies 570
acres, and is excavated to a depth of 26ft.&nbsp; Two massive
piers protect it, running out to the sea in a north-easterly
direction for about a mile and a half.&nbsp; At starting they are
1,440 yards apart, narrowing to 770 yards, the navigable entrance
being about 150 yards wide.&nbsp; The piers are constructed of
artificial stone, composed of seven parts of sand from the
desert, and of one part of hydraulic lime from France.&nbsp; The
concrete was mixed by machinery, and then poured into great
wooden moulds, where it remained for weeks, after which the wood
was taken away to allow of the blocks hardening.&nbsp; Each block
weighed twenty tons, and contained 13&frac12; cubic yards; no
fewer than 25,000 of these blocks were used in constructing the
breakwater.&nbsp; The lighthouse is a very handsome structure,
and is also formed of blocks of concrete; it is 164ft. high, and
can be seen twenty-four miles away, being fitted with the
electric light.&nbsp; (<i>Baedeker</i>).</p>
<p>At 4.30 p.m. our vessel started for the Canal, and having
safely entered it made fast for the night, as no travelling is
allowed after sunset.&nbsp; During the evening myriads of gnats
and mosquitoes came on to the ship, the electric light being
absolutely dimmed by them in many places, and we had good reason
to expect a trying night from their presence.</p>
<p>While our ship&rsquo;s doctor and a party of friends were
ashore at Port Sa&iuml;d they were greatly amused by the <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>attention
of a number of Arab lads who followed them everywhere.&nbsp;
During their walk in the native quarter the party came upon a
great crowd, and one of the young Arabs referring to the man who
had been hanged during the morning stated that the man was not an
Arab, but a Greek, and proceeded to explain the distinguishing
characteristics of the various nationalities represented at this
cosmopolitan port; he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Greek, he bery bat man, he stab&mdash;so (with a
vigorous motion as though stabbing an opponent in the chest).</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;gyptian, he bery goot man, he only slap, so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;English man, he bery goot man (striking an attitude);
he say &lsquo;Come on and box.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;English man&mdash;he bery goot man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;English man&mdash;he bery goot man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melikan man&mdash;he bery goot man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Melikan man&mdash;he bery goot man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;talian man&mdash;he bery bat man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ending with a very uncomplimentary allusion to our Irish
fellow-subjects.</p>
<p>What is wanted to make Port Sa&iuml;d really prosperous is a
railway from the interior to bring the produce from the cotton
and wheat fields, and then the steamers which bring the coals
could at once load up for home, saving the necessity of going
empty to Alexandria for their homeward freights.&nbsp; Last year
540,000 tons of coal were sold at Port Sa&iuml;d, and all the
ships which brought it had to go away empty.&nbsp; But so long as
the Canal Company are entitled to all the Customs dues at Port
Sa&iuml;d, it is not to be expected that the Egyptian Government
will favour the construction of such a line.</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>Some
of our fellow-passengers were members of the Blue Ribbon Army,
and although they were by no means obtrusive in supporting their
views, being contented for the most part with wearing the
&ldquo;bit of blue&rdquo;&mdash;others resented this reasonable
liberty, styling it an impertinence, and formed themselves into
an opposition Order, which they called the <i>Red</i> Ribbon
Army, and they busied themselves in enlisting recruits.&nbsp; It
was noticeable that, with the exception of an old
<i>rou&eacute;</i> or two, only young men with small heads and
long legs, who, if they ever indulged in reading, confined their
choice to books translated or adapted from the French, composed
the rank and file, the officers being older men, who were not
often seen out of the gambling or smoke-room.&nbsp; One of these
latter was called the &ldquo;Spider,&rdquo; because from an early
hour in the morning he sat in the smoke-room waiting to
&ldquo;play&rdquo; with any who might choose to try conclusions
with him.</p>
<p>The Patron and President of the Society was a noble lord, and
certainly a better choice could not have been made.&nbsp; Amongst
the rules of the Society were these:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Any member found without his red ribbon is to be
fined in drinks all round.</p>
<p>Members are to be neither too drunk nor too sober.</p>
<p>Members must never go to bed quite sober.</p>
<p>Members must never refuse a drink.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The President certainly set a fair example in his endeavour to
perform the duties of his office, and would never be mistaken for
a member of the Blue Ribbon Army, even if he did not wear the
badge, for good wine had marked him for its own.&nbsp; Under the
<a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>fostering influence of such rules and such a
&ldquo;noble&rdquo; example, it is not to be wondered at that the
Army showed a blatant front to the enemy, and that their
proceedings soon became disorderly.&nbsp; At this juncture some
good-natured moderate men joined the Reds, with the view, it
appears, of moderating their offensive tactics, and the result
was a manifesto which set forth, amongst other things&mdash;That
the Red Ribbon Army entertained no feelings of ill-will toward
those who did not agree with them, and invited all to join their
ranks, and that they assured abstainers that there was always
iced water on the sideboard of the smoke room for their
convenience.&nbsp; One of the chiefs of the Reds was a dark man,
already referred to as Cetewayo, <i>alias</i> the Carrib.&nbsp; I
one day heard this worthy call one of the Reds to account for
appearing without his badge, the defaulting member replying that
he had &ldquo;resigned.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t
do,&rdquo; said the Carrib, &ldquo;Once a member always a member;
come and pay up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yes, I thought, when the devil has
once got his claws in a man retreat is all but impossible.</p>
<p>Every one of the young fellows who joined the Reds fell into
the &ldquo;Spider&rsquo;s&rdquo; web, and were most of them eased
of their spare cash through the agency of a pack of cards.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;Spider&rdquo; was one day on deck sitting by the
side of one of my friends who had just awaked from a doze, to
whom he said, &ldquo;You have had a nap?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Mr. &mdash; takes his nap on
deck in the face of day, but you have yours in the dimness of the
smoke-room&rdquo; (alluding to the game of
&ldquo;Nap&rdquo;).&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I like to play when the light <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>is somewhat
dull.&nbsp; These fellows say I am always winning.&nbsp; Well,
suppose I am?&nbsp; They keep coming to me, and in Melbourne if
they consult an expert on any subject they have to pay two
guineas, and I take no less.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You take no
less, and don&rsquo;t refuse more,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Exactly, that is just it,&rdquo; said the Spider, and he
was said to have cleared out most of the card-playing
fraternity.&nbsp; Ultimately, the almost unvaried success of the
Spider caused a general feeling to be raised against him amongst
the gamblers; but as long as there still remained some who had
not been relieved of their money, and others whom the Spider had
allowed to win from him occasionally, this feeling did not exist
to any great extent.&nbsp; One evening, however, the Pirate
charged the web-spinner with having cheated him, and a general
disturbance ensued, the Pirate assuring the Spider that as soon
as they quitted the ship he would soundly thrash him with a whip,
which he displayed, so we were in hopes of having a little
excitement on leaving the vessel.&nbsp; One result, however, was
to practically dissolve the Red Ribbon army, and the Carrib then
came out in a new character.&nbsp; At the fancy dress ball held
on the promenade deck he appeared in a dress suit, and was at
once saluted with the cry, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a lark, Cetewayo
disguised as a <i>gentleman</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The noble President of the Reds was somewhat of a curiosity in
his way, a very kind-hearted sympathetic man, as many a poor
invalid in the second and third classes could testify.&nbsp; The
doctor told us of many instances of his lordship&rsquo;s kindness
in visiting some of the sick third-class passengers, and giving
them dainties from his private stores; and I heard one poor woman
<a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>tell him
she should never forget him for his goodness to her
husband.&nbsp; Some of our colonial passengers, wishing to make
the most of their unusual proximity to nobility, were too
persevering in their attentions to his lordship, and evidently
bored him; but the tact with which he &ldquo;shunted&rdquo; them,
and the studied politeness of his language, did not prevent
onlookers detecting a silent &ldquo;confound their
impudence&rdquo; terminating each reply.</p>

<p>Once, in referring to the pertinacity of these people, he
remarked to a bystander, in a hissing tone, &ldquo;One
<i>must</i> be civ-il.&rdquo;&nbsp; The noble lord took a great
interest in everything pertaining to sailors; his regard for them
was evidently warm and genuine.&nbsp; While we were passing
through <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>the Canal, coming to our anchorage for the night, we
found the space at our disposal was very limited, as the vessels
were numerous, consequently our men had to be very active in
getting the ship into her berth.&nbsp; I was standing by his
lordship&rsquo;s side, looking at the sailors running along the
sandbank, carrying the heavy cable as nimbly as though it was a
fishing line.&nbsp; Lord &mdash; was delighted, and, turning to
me, and in his funny fashion grasping his clothes in front of the
place where his stomach should be, exclaimed in tones of rapture,
&ldquo;Look at our <i>de-ah</i> blue-jackets, look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His lordship was very popular with the young men on board, but
I hope he did not often make such observations to them, as one
young gentleman informed me he had made to him, speaking of his
past life.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have committed many sins in my
time,&rdquo; said his lordship, &ldquo;and I hope to live to
commit many more.&rdquo;</p>

238</span>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p>Returning from Australia we touched at Colombo, where my
companion and a friend paid an interesting visit to Arabi, who
invited them to dine with him.&nbsp; It soon became evident that
intercourse would have to be conducted through interpreters, as
Arabi understood neither French nor English, and his visitors
were ignorant of Arabic.</p>
<p>My friend was an invalid, and the first dish put on the table
caused him great anxiety, as it was one which his medical man had
given him strict orders to avoid.&nbsp; What was to be
done?&nbsp; My companion explained to the invalid that in the
East no greater affront could be given to a host than to decline
to partake of what was offered, and so, not having provided
himself with Jack the Giant Killer&rsquo;s device for disposing
of surplus food, he was fain to eat it, not without certain
fearful forebodings.</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>Arabi&rsquo;s personal appearance had greatly altered,
he having grown a beard which was turning grey.&nbsp; At the
table with him were his two sons, lads apparently of ten and
twelve years respectively.&nbsp; On his left sat Fehmi Pasha, a
man of very striking appearance with a face indicating
considerable intellectual power.&nbsp; Arabi desired to know what
the English thought of him, a question which my companion parried
by saying the English always respected a brave man.&nbsp; Rising
to take leave of the host, my companion patted the head of the
eldest boy in a kindly manner.&nbsp; This seemed to move Arabi in
a singular way.&nbsp; He rose and said, in a sharp tone of
command, to his boys, &ldquo;Salaam,&rdquo; then, crossing the
room and placing his hand on my companion&rsquo;s shoulder, said
with some emotion, &ldquo;Ah, ah, good, good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proceeding on our voyage we called at Aden, a dreadful place,
without a single redeeming feature, in European eyes.&nbsp; Those
of our countrymen who are compelled to reside here in the service
of the country are entitled to the deepest sympathy of every
Englishman.&nbsp; The possession of Aden is of considerable
importance to England and to India, both as a coaling station and
as a military post, although in the latter respect it is of less
importance than formerly.&nbsp; The islands commanding the
channels at the entrance to the Red Sea are after all the key to
the position, one of the most important being the Island of
Perim, the acquisition of which does more credit to the
<i>&rsquo;cuteness</i> of the British commander at Aden than to
his sense of honour&mdash;that is, if the story told of him be
true.&nbsp; It is related that one evening, nearly forty years
ago, two <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>French war-ships cast anchor before Aden, and the
English governor with a laudable desire to ascertain the object
of their visit invited the commanders of the ships to
dinner.&nbsp; Unfortunately for France the officers were not
teetotallers, and the weather being hot and the British
commander&rsquo;s wine strong, the gallant Frenchmen&rsquo;s
tongues were loosened, and the perfidious Englishman ascertained
that the mission with which his guests were charged was no less
than the occupation of the Island of Perim in the name of Louis
Philippe, King of the French!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Without losing a moment the governor sent orders to the
captain of the English gunboat lying at Aden to proceed with all
speed and in the strictest secrecy to take possession of the
island in the name of the Queen!&nbsp; The sun had risen before
the festivities at the governor&rsquo;s residence had ceased, and
then with many bows his guests departed to their ships, and
shortly afterwards left <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>Aden for their destination.&nbsp; On
arrival, their astonishment and mortification may be imagined
when they saw on the highest point on the island the British flag
flying, and the gunboat which they had seen at Aden on the
previous day anchored close inshore.&nbsp; The incident gave
occasion for much tall talk at the time on the part of the fiery
French colonels, and, not without reason, I fear, gave fresh life
to the cry of &ldquo;Perfidious Albion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We arrived at Suez in the third week of February, and as soon
as our steamer stopped, our old dragoman Hassan came on board
with a huge packet of letters for us, and although he had only
seen us once before, three years ago, he not only remembered our
names but came straight to us and told us he had brought a boat
for our use, and that bedrooms were engaged for us at the
hotel.&nbsp; We owed all this attention&mdash;which was most
seasonable, as I was still suffering from the effects of a
malarious fever contracted in Australia&mdash;to Messrs. Cook and
Son, who had been advised of my coming, and here I will say that
in Egypt and Syria the name of &ldquo;Cook&rdquo; is the talisman
which solves all difficulties and robs travelling of nearly all
its inconveniences.</p>
<p>On landing we were forcibly struck with the altered demeanour
of the people since our previous visit.&nbsp; On that occasion
landing was effected under the greatest difficulties.&nbsp; The
people seemed to look upon us as fair prey.&nbsp; It was almost
impossible for us to keep our luggage together, and the insolent
threatening manner in which <i>backsheesh</i> was demanded was
not a little disturbing to those who were visiting an eastern
country for the first time.&nbsp; But now all was <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>changed;
instead of idle excited crowds loitering everywhere, everyone
seemed to be engaged in some work, <i>backsheesh</i> was rarely
asked for, and always in subdued tones, and one refusal was
enough.&nbsp; Even the donkey boys had been reached, for when
their proffered services were declined they went away with a
&ldquo;thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Suez Hotel is kept by an Englishman, and he informed us
that during the war he left it in charge of natives, and found
everything safe and in order on his return.</p>
<p>On the following day we proceeded by railway to Cairo,
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Ismailia and Tel-el-Kebir.&nbsp; At many of the
stations British soldiers were on guard, a part of their duty
appearing to be the inspection of the natives&rsquo; baggage;
this was done amidst much good humour on both sides&mdash;indeed,
all through Egypt the British soldier seemed to be on the best
possible terms with the people, as indeed there is every reason
why he should be, for it is certain he has been the means of
saving the people of Egypt from a tyranny of the worst
kind&mdash;the tyranny of rapacious pachas, civil and
military.&nbsp; With the usual exclusiveness of our nation, our
party of four had arranged to have the whole of the compartment
of the railway-carriage to ourselves.&nbsp; It is true we paid
extra for the convenience, but at one of the stations, the train
being very crowded, two Frenchmen endeavoured to enter, being
prevented, however, by the Arab conductor.&nbsp; The Frenchmen,
with much gesticulation and great volubility, pointed out to the
Arab that there were only four persons in the carriage, whereas
it was constructed to take eight; the guard insisted that there
were eight persons <a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>in the compartment, although it was patent to all that
there were only four.&nbsp; &ldquo;Four!&rdquo; said the
Frenchmen.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eight!&rdquo; returned the guard, giving
us a most wicked wink, which, however, failed to extort
<i>backsheesh</i>.&nbsp; Ultimately our would-be companions were
safely bestowed elsewhere.</p>
<p>The railway passes by the field of Tel-el-Kebir, the
entrenchments stretching as far as the eye can reach.&nbsp; When
my companion went over the ground a few weeks after the battle it
was covered with debris of every kind, clothing, arms,
ammunition, and other ghastly indications of a battle-field.</p>
<p>In one of the entrenchments my friend found a leaf torn from
the New Testament, while only a yard or two away was a leaf from
the Koran, and hard by he picked up a letter written in Arabic,
addressed to a soldier on the field, requesting him to authorise
the writer to collect his rents in Cairo.</p>
<p>On reaching the station of Tel-el-Kebir we found a number of
tourists who had come up from Cairo to gather curiosities from
the battle-field, but since my friend&rsquo;s visit in the autumn
everything had been cleared off, and the new comers were
gathering pebbles (!) as mementoes of the famous engagement.</p>
<p>The little grave-yard in which the British troops are buried
is situated near to the station, and appeared to be kept in
excellent order.</p>
<p>In Cairo, as in Suez, the absence of the feverish excitement,
latent insolence, and spirit of unrest, so apparent during our
last visit, was very noticeable.&nbsp; There, too,
<i>backsheesh</i> was rarely demanded, and most of the people
seemed to have something to do.</p>
<p><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>It
was curious to see the English soldiers lounging about the town
in all directions.&nbsp; They seemed to be quite at home.&nbsp;
One of them informed me he had gone through the Transvaal
campaign, but very much preferred the land of Goshen!</p>
<p>While we were in Cairo we often expressed our wonder that the
city was ever free from cholera or some other deadly
epidemic.&nbsp; The sanitary condition of the streets and public
places was shocking in the extreme.</p>
<p>Fronting the Opera House and the great hotels and Government
offices are the extensive Ezbekiyeh public gardens, enclosed with
iron railings.&nbsp; Around the outside is a very handsome paved
footpath, which, although in the very heart of the city, is in
many places utterly impassable because of the unspeakable horrors
accumulated upon it.&nbsp; If the English occupation of Egypt
does nothing more than cause the towns of that country to be
properly cleansed, it will be the means of saving as many lives
every few years as were lost in the late campaign.</p>
<p>There are two classes of people who undoubtedly view the
British occupation of Egypt with great and well-founded
dislike&mdash;the military party and the pachas.&nbsp; These
classes have always played into each other&rsquo;s hands, and
always at the expense of the down-trodden and patient
fellaheen&mdash;the backbone and mainstay of the country.&nbsp;
For the latter class the presence of the British army is an
almost unmixed blessing.</p>
<p>From time immemorial the desirability of connecting the
Mediterranean and Red Seas by a canal has been fully recognised;
but the work does not appear to have been attempted before the
reign of Pharaoh Necho, who <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>undertook to construct a canal
between the Nile and the Red Sea.&nbsp; In carrying out this work
120,000 Egyptians perished, and before it was completed the King
abandoned it, having been informed by the Oracle that the
foreigners alone would profit by the work.&nbsp; Eventually the
canal was completed under the rule of Darius the Persian, and of
the Ptolemies.</p>
<p>The canal was carried through the lakes Balah and Menzaleh,
another branch being constructed to the Bitter Lakes, into which
the fresh water canal&mdash;watering the land of
Goshen&mdash;emptied itself; but owing to the constant state of
war it fell into decay, and was abandoned.</p>
<p>Many suggestions as to the reopening of the waterway have been
made in almost every generation since.&nbsp; Bonaparte, during
his expedition to Egypt in 1798, even caused the preliminary
works to be undertaken.&nbsp; His chief engineer surveyed the
ground, but, owing to a serious miscalculation, threw great doubt
on the possibility of carrying out the work.&nbsp; He estimated
the level of the Red Sea to be nearly 33ft. higher than that of
the Mediterranean, an idea that Leibnitz ridiculed nearly a
century before.&nbsp; Vigorous protests against
Lep&egrave;re&rsquo;s theory were not wanting, but it was,
nevertheless, sufficient to cause the abandonment of the scheme
until Monsieur Lesseps directed his attention to the
matter.&nbsp; On his appointment as an Attach&eacute; to the
French Mission, Lesseps had to undergo a lengthy quarantine at
Alexandria; here he was supplied with books by his Consul, among
them being Lep&egrave;re&rsquo;s memoirs respecting the scheme
for connecting the two seas, the effect of which upon the young
Frenchman&rsquo;s mind was never effaced.</p>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>In
1847 a Commission of Engineers demonstrated the inaccuracy of
Lep&egrave;re&rsquo;s observations, and proved that the level of
the two seas was practically the same.&nbsp; In 1854 Lesseps
having matured his plan laid it before the Viceroy, who
determined to carry it out.&nbsp; Palmerston, then premier, did
his utmost, from political motives, to thwart the enterprise; but
early in 1856 permission was given to commence the work.</p>
<p>Considerable difficulty was experienced in raising the
capital, but on the 25th April, 1858, operations were actually
begun.&nbsp; The Viceroy undertook to pay many of the current
expenses, and provided 25,000 workmen, who were to be paid and
fed by the Company at an inexpensive rate, and were to be
relieved every three months.&nbsp; In order to provide these men
with water 4,000 casks suitable for being carried on camels had
to be made, and 1,600 of these animals were daily employed in
bringing supplies, at a cost of &pound;320 per day.</p>
<p>At the end of December, 1863, the Fresh Water Canal was
completed, by which the Company was relieved of the enormous
expense of supplying the workmen with water.</p>
<p>On the 18th March, 1869, the water of the Mediterranean was
allowed to flow into the nearly dry salt-incrusted basins of the
Bitter Lakes, some parts of which lay forty feet below the level
of the Mediterranean, while others required extensive dredging
operations.&nbsp; The Bitter Lakes have been identified with the
Marah of the Bible (Exodus xv., 23&mdash;&ldquo;And when they
came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah for
they were bitter&rdquo;).&nbsp; The captain of our vessel
informed <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>me that in these lakes the saltness, and consequently
the density, of the water is such as to cause the vessel to rise
five inches above the ordinary waterline.</p>
<p>The cost of constructing the Canal amounted to about
&pound;19,000,000, more than a third of which was contributed by
the Khedive.&nbsp; The original capital of the company in 400,000
shares amounted to &pound;8,000,000, the difference being raised
by loans payable at fixed intervals, and adding an annual burden
to the scheme of &pound;451,000.&nbsp; The festivities connected
with the opening of the Canal in 1869 cost the Khedive&mdash;that
is to say the taxpayer of Egypt&mdash;&pound;14,200,000, or more
than half the total capital!</p>
<p>The great mercantile importance of the Canal is apparent from
the following data:&mdash;Between London and Bombay forty-four
per cent. of the distance is saved by through-going ships;
between London and Hong Kong twenty-eight per cent., and between
Marseilles and Bombay fifty-nine per cent.&nbsp; Over eighty per
cent. of the trade passing through the Canal is done in British
vessels, and in 1875&mdash;or six years after the Canal was
opened&mdash;the English traffic was equal to twelve times that
of the French.</p>
<p>In 1870, 486 steamers, representing 493,911 tons, passed
through the canal, and in 1882 these figures had risen to 3,198
steamers with 7,125,000 tons.&nbsp; (<i>Baedeker</i>).</p>
<p>From Port Sa&iuml;d the Canal runs in a nearly straight line
to Kantara (a mere group of sheds), its course lying across the
shallow lagoon-like Lake Menzaleh, which has an average depth of
only three feet.&nbsp; The embankments are low, irregular
sand-banks, formed of the dredged <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>material, and having at the margin
of the water a coarse growth of straggling sedgy-looking
vegetation.&nbsp; After passing Kantara, the Balah Lakes are
reached, and the course is marked out in their open surface by a
double line of buoys.&nbsp; Then the most difficult portion of
the original work is reached&mdash;viz., the cutting of El Guisr,
which is six miles long, the depth from ground-level to surface
of water being about forty-five feet.&nbsp; This is by far the
highest land in the Isthmus.&nbsp; Leaving the El Guisr cutting,
the open waters of Lake Timsah, (<i>Crocodile Lake</i>) are
reached, and far away across its blue mirror-like surface
stretches the double line of buoys, marking out the track.&nbsp;
On the northern shore of the lake, buried in a delightful mass of
vegetation, lies the French town of Ismail&iuml;a, once the great
centre from which operations during the construction of the Canal
were conducted, and now one of the principal stations whence its
navigation is controlled by means of telegraph.&nbsp; Lake Timsah
has an area of some six or seven square miles, and the huge fleet
of war vessels, transports, and tenders which Lord Wolseley used
as a base for his operations in the late campaign lay there
without difficulty.&nbsp; From Lake Timsah the Suez Canal holds a
roughly parallel course with the Freshwater Canal and the Suez
line of railway, and passes through a long cutting into the
Bitter Lakes, an extremely tame and uninteresting sheet of water
some fifteen miles long, with flat, low, sandy banks, and thence
into another long cutting&mdash;some twenty-six feet deep at
Shalouf&mdash;after which the flat sandy plains of Suez are
traversed, and the head of the gulf reached.</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>The
impression is general that the Suez Canal is cut through immense
deposits of sand, or sand and water, but this is quite
erroneous.&nbsp; The desert, it is true, is sandy and sterile,
but the sand is quite superficial, covering a gypseous clay, not
at all difficult to work in.&nbsp; From Balah to the Bitter Lakes
there is fine muddy sand, with clay at intervals, and at Serapeum
a rocky barrier.&nbsp; From the Bitter Lakes to Suez, however,
there is a good clay, with limestone at Shalouf.&nbsp; The
sinuosities in the Canal are such as to render the passage of
vessels over 400 feet long somewhat difficult.&nbsp; It was
expected that these curves would prevent the washing away of the
banks, but it is doubtful whether they have at all contributed to
the preservation of the sandy embankments.&nbsp; Indeed, most of
the predictions of the early destruction of the Canal by the
operation of natural causes have been proved to be as ill-founded
as such predictions generally are.&nbsp; The banks have no
ill-regulated propensity for crumbling away.&nbsp; The Canal is
<i>not</i> in perpetual and imminent danger of being
silted-up.&nbsp; The enormous and costly dredging operations that
were to swallow more than the revenue of the undertaking are
unknown, and the sole matter for regret is that the Canal was not
made as wide again as it is, for the accommodation of the vast
traffic it has created.&nbsp; Among the many confident prophesies
made by professional engineers of the day, one stands recorded in
the technical papers to the effect that every vessel must
necessarily be towed through the Canal, the explanation being
that the regulation speed of five miles per hour was not
sufficient to afford steering &ldquo;way&rdquo;; hence, said the
prophet, the slightest <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>wind across the line of the Canal
must infallibly blow ashore any vessel whose commander should
have the temerity to attempt to steam between the two seas.&nbsp;
Experience, however, has shown that the largest vessels are under
perfect command when propelled by their own engines.</p>
<p>It is impossible for anyone to pass through the Canal without
being impressed with the urgent necessity for vastly increased
accommodation for the constantly augmenting traffic.&nbsp; The
delays occasioned by the difficulties in coaling, the blocks in
the Canal&mdash;caused sometimes by the enormous traffic, and
sometimes by the sinking of a ship across the narrow
channel&mdash;are most vexatious.&nbsp; No less than five days
elapsed between the time of the arrival of our steamer at Port
Sa&iuml;d and of its departure from Suez, a distance of less than
one hundred miles.</p>
<p>In every way it is most unfortunate for English commerce
that&mdash;thanks to the mulish obstinacy of Lord
Palmerston&mdash;the management of the Canal should have been
thrown into the hands of Frenchmen; for, while according the
highest meed of praise to M. de Lesseps for his genius, tenacity
of purpose, and energy, in designing and carrying out such a vast
undertaking in the teeth of obstacles which would have daunted
most men, it is impossible to ignore the fact that, as compared
with English traffic-managers, the French officials responsible
for the working of the Canal are vastly inferior in
capacity.&nbsp; The spirit of officialism as displayed by a
liberal use of red tape, and a certain non-elasticity in carrying
out the laws, so familiar to all travellers in France, exists in
an intensified <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>form in the local management of the Canal.&nbsp; To the
ordinary traveller through the Canal, for example, it seems
absurd that vessels should be stopped for the night while some
hours of light remain, yet as soon as the sun goes down no
further advance can be made.&nbsp; Again, although daylight comes
long before sunrise, it is forbidden to move till the sun is
up.&nbsp; Then again, experience shows that by the use of the
electric light the largest vessels can be handled with the utmost
ease.&nbsp; An electric light fixed in the foremast of a ship
sweeps the Canal from bank to bank, and for all practical
purposes gives a light equal to that of day; it seems strange,
therefore, that vessels possessing such appliances should not be
permitted to proceed during the night.&nbsp; If one ventures to
make such a suggestion to a Canal official, he at once replies
that the rules laid down for the regulation of the traffic forbid
night passages, and if one further ventures to remind him that
the said rules were made before the introduction of electric
lighting, he shrugs his shoulders and plainly intimates that you
have tried his patience long enough.</p>
<p>A little delegation of authority from the chief office to the
pilot or other Canal official on board the ships would at once
result in a vast diminution of delay, and consequently in an
increase to the capability of the Canal, but the genius of French
administration appears to be opposed to the granting of any
latitude or freedom of action to inferior officials, and so in
the administration of the Canal everything is done by the
official at the chief office in Ismail&iuml;a, who transmits his
orders by telegraph.</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>But,
after all the practicable improvements in the navigation of the
present Canal have been made, the necessity for a new one will be
no less urgent, and it is especially unfortunate that the
Conservative party should have made negotiations with M. de
Lesseps so difficult by openly suggesting that we should use our
accidental supremacy in Egypt to advance the national interests,
without regard to the rights possessed by him.&nbsp; Whatever the
actual status of M. de Lesseps, under his concession, may be, it
is clear that he has always considered he had a monopoly.&nbsp;
At the outset he endeavoured to enlist British sympathy and
capital in his undertaking by demonstrating that the bulk of the
traffic must necessarily come from English sources.&nbsp; Was it
probable, therefore, he would have spent the Company&rsquo;s
capital in making the Canal if, after having demonstrated its
success, an English company were at liberty to make another,
alongside, and take away four-fifths of its traffic?</p>
<p>In business matters the French are proverbially
short-sighted.&nbsp; They fail to see that &ldquo;three sixpences
are better than one shilling,&rdquo; and are consequently
unwilling to surrender present advantages without an absolute
certainty of an early and great benefit arising from their doing
so.&nbsp; They are much more truly a nation of retailers or
shopkeepers than the English are, notwithstanding
Napoleon&rsquo;s famous epithet.&nbsp; What is wanted is a
greater breadth of view in the administration of the Canal, and
it is in this respect that it is particularly unfortunate there
is not a larger English representation on the Board of
Management.&nbsp; If we had a representation equal to our share
of the capital, <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>the result would soon be apparent in the adoption of a
line of policy giving the utmost facilities to the Canal&rsquo;s
customers, to the great advantage of both.</p>
<p>The recent discussions upon the Suez Canal question cannot
fail to be of the greatest use to the Government when they reopen
negotiations with M. de Lesseps, and if the latter finds it
impossible to make another canal without a further concession of
land, he may probably think it advisable to conciliate his
partner and chief customer by making greater concessions in
return for the influence of the British Government with that of
the Khedive and the Sultan on his behalf.</p>
<p>But even if no further advantages for British commerce be
obtained from the Canal Company, this country occupies a unique
position as regards communication with the East.&nbsp; In less
than fifteen years the whole of the original cost of the British
shares, both principal and interest, will have been paid out of
profits, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer of the day will have
to decide as to the destination of the revenue which the shares
produce.&nbsp; It appears to me that, after making provision for
the necessary expenses attending the administration of the
property, it would be both just and politic to return the balance
to the owners of the ships whose use of the Canal has been the
means of creating the revenue.&nbsp; If this course be adopted
British commerce will be immensely benefited, for our ships will
be able to use the Canal at a little more than half the expense
falling upon those of other nations, and this great advantage
will have been obtained without having cost the British taxpayer
a single penny.&nbsp; The money will simply be returned into <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>the hands
which contributed it, and the proposal, therefore, does not in
any way partake of the character of a bounty.</p>
<p>What is known as the Dual Control was established in
1879.&nbsp; By it the British and French Controllers-General were
invested with considerable powers over the administration of the
finances, in addition to which the Khedive undertook to assign a
certain portion of the revenue for the discharge of the national
obligations.</p>
<p>In the following year a Law of Liquidation, as drawn up by the
Commissioners appointed for the purpose, was issued with the
agreement of all the interested European Powers.</p>
<p>In return for these concessions, the Foreign Bondholders made
a compromise with the Egyptian Government involving the surrender
of a considerable portion of their claims.&nbsp; This settlement,
while relieving the country from an enormous burden, placed it in
a position to meet its liabilities and to progress in the
development of its resources, and, in the language of Lord
Granville in his despatch to Lord Dufferin, &ldquo;it was
undoubtedly working well for the material prosperity of the
country, and promised to do so for the future;&rdquo; and in a
subsequent despatch the Foreign Secretary declared that, through
the action of the Control, great advantages had been secured for
the natives, such as &ldquo;the spread of education, the
abolition of vexatious taxation, the establishment of the
land-tax on a regular and equitable basis, and the diminution of
forced labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our dragoman, an intelligent Copt, fully corroborated Lord
Granville&rsquo;s statement.&nbsp; He said that all that <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>the
Egyptian people required was moderate taxation, certainty as to
its amount and as to the time of its collection, and such a
military law as would relieve them from the press-gang.&nbsp; He
further said that before the institution of the Control, whenever
the Khedive wanted a new ironclad, or a new palace, or half a
dozen additional inmates for his harem, he ordered a new tax to
be levied; this tax was sold to some of the rapacious pachas
about the Palace, and resold by them to professional
tax-gatherers.&nbsp; These wretches committed the greatest
atrocities upon the miserable fellaheen, exacting the uttermost
farthing under the threat, and often the actual application, of
torture; &ldquo;but now,&rdquo; said my informant,
&ldquo;although the taxes are heavy, their amount is known, and
they are collected in coin after the harvest has been
gathered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The country was becoming very prosperous, and there was a
surplus in the Treasury when, in February, 1881, a military riot
broke out, originating in the arrest of certain Egyptian
officers, among whom was the Colonel of the 1st Regiment.&nbsp;
The officers of this regiment broke into the Council Room of the
Ministry of War, ill-treated the Minister, and then, having
released the prisoners, proceeded to the Khedive&rsquo;s Palace,
followed by the men of the regiment.&nbsp; In menacing tones they
demanded the dismissal of the Minister of War, and redress for
their grievances.&nbsp; Arabi Bey was one of the chief actors in
this revolt.&nbsp; The Khedive was compelled to submit, the
mutinous colonels were reinstated, and tranquillity was restored
for the time.</p>
<p><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>The
army officers were not long, however, in showing what their
principal object was, for in a few weeks after the revolt,
decrees were issued increasing the pay of the army and navy to
the extent of nearly &pound;60,000 a year.&nbsp; The
Controllers-General had now become aware that everything was at
the disposal of the military party, and that the Minister could
not guarantee that the officers would not next day insist upon
fresh financial concessions.&nbsp; The next demand made by the
colonels was that nominations to vacant posts in regiments should
rest with them, and this was granted.&nbsp; The object of all
this was clear enough&mdash;indeed, Arabi declared at one of the
meetings of the Commission that &ldquo;he would not yield
unconditional obedience to the War Minister.&rdquo;&nbsp; As time
went on fresh symptoms of disaffection broke out, all indicating
the determination of the military party to throw off all control
and restraint.&nbsp; In September the Ministry was dismissed at
the instance of these same men, who throughout the remainder of
the year continued a harassing series of turbulent outbreaks,
gradually increasing in audacity, and more and more trenching
upon matters of administration.&nbsp; They went so far as to
demand an increase in the army, involving an annual addition to
the estimates of &pound;280,000, although the Controllers
declared that not nearly half that amount was available.</p>
<p>The principal figure in all these outbreaks was Arabi, who
steadily kept himself at the head of the disaffected party, and
gradually increased his influence.&nbsp; After being appointed
Under Secretary of War, then Chief Secretary, he was described by
Sir E. Malet as having become &ldquo;Arbiter of the destinies of
the <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>country.&rdquo;&nbsp; In March he was made Pasha, and
the Khedive was compelled to assent to a number of promotions by
Arabi, who insisted on dispensing with the examination required
by law for officers.&nbsp; In a word, the real power had become
vested in the chiefs of the military party, and the objects of
those chiefs were showing themselves more and more evidently to
be, increase of the army, increase of pay and promotion of a
large number of officers to high military rank&mdash;the desire
of all such men in every country of the world.</p>
<p>In the following month Arabi caused numerous arrests to be
made among the officers and soldiery in consequence of an alleged
conspiracy to murder him.&nbsp; Among the prisoners was the
Minister of War, who had been dismissed at the demand of the
mutinous regiments in the previous February.&nbsp; The prisoners
were tried by a court-martial&mdash;irregularly
constituted&mdash;and the proceedings were kept secret, while no
counsel were allowed for the defence.&nbsp; It was generally
believed that torture had been used to extort confession.&nbsp;
Forty officers were condemned to exile for life to the farthest
limits of the Soudan.&nbsp; The Khedive, with great courage,
refused to sanction the sentence, and issued a decree commuting
it to simple banishment from Egypt.</p>
<p>In the meantime the excitement continued to increase, and the
Governments of France and England decided to send a naval force
to Alexandria for the protection of the interests of their
subjects in Egypt.&nbsp; The combined fleet arrived at Alexandria
on the 20th of May.&nbsp; On June 11th the great riot and
massacre of Europeans took place, Arabi in the meanwhile erecting
<a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>new
earthworks and strengthening the forts, in spite of his repeated
assurances to the contrary.&nbsp; On July 11th, the French fleet
having withdrawn, and twenty-four hours&rsquo; notice having
expired, Admiral Seymour opened fire on the forts, and after a
few hours completely silenced them; not, however, without his
ships having suffered considerably in the encounter.</p>
<p>The above is a sketch of Arabi&rsquo;s career from the time of
his first coming into public notice to the time when he became
Dictator.&nbsp; He was at no pains to conceal his character as a
military adventurer, and every successive step in his career
proves him to have been no other.&nbsp; It is true that during
the last few weeks he appeared to carry the country with him,
which, however, is not difficult to account for, seeing that he
was &ldquo;master of the legions,&rdquo; and that detachments of
the army had been sent out into the highways and byways to compel
men to come in at the point of the bayonet.&nbsp; In ordinary
times it is no uncommon thing to see a chain-gang going through
the streets of Egyptian towns composed, not of criminals, but of
unhappy wretches brought in by the press-gang for service in the
army, and should any of them falter in their steps through
weariness or despair, the heavy stick of the driver is always
ready to descend upon their shoulders.&nbsp; The only effect of
the success of the movement headed by Arabi would have been the
perpetuation and extension of this terrible state of things; and
yet this is the man who has been persistently held up to the
admiration of the world as a pure-minded patriot by a large
section of what is called the Peace Party in <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>England.&nbsp; In the towns Arabi and his agents worked
upon the cupidity of the lower orders by telling them that he
intended to drive the foreigners into the sea, and that their
property should be given over to a general loot.&nbsp; In the
country districts, where the fellaheen are ground down under the
heel of the usurer&mdash;always a foreigner, as the Koran forbids
usury&mdash;Arabi promised to cancel the village debts, and
banish the usurers; <a name="citation259a"></a><a
href="#footnote259a" class="citation">[259a]</a> while in Upper
Egypt, where usury is less common, he appealed to Mohammedan
fanaticism.&nbsp; But nowhere did he appeal to a national
sentiment, <a name="citation259b"></a><a href="#footnote259b"
class="citation">[259b]</a> until, indeed, by various devices, he
had become absolute master of the country, when perhaps he
thought he might say <i>L&rsquo;Etat, c&rsquo;est moi</i>.</p>
<h2><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>A wretched journey of over eight hours by rail brought us to
Alexandria shortly before midnight.&nbsp; A fierce gale with rain
prevailed during most of the journey, and owing to the
dilapidated condition of the carriage, waterproofs were necessary
to protect us from the rain, which, in spite of closed windows,
found access to every part of the compartment.&nbsp; The line
itself and the whole of the rolling stock, were in a miserable
condition of disrepair, and utterly unfit for traffic.</p>
<p>The drive from the railway station to the Hotel Abbat gave us
our first glimpse of the ruin wrought by the rioters.&nbsp; The
raging storm and drenching sleet were singularly in accord with
the scene of desolation and misery on every hand.&nbsp; After the
long and cold railway journey, and the drive in the open vehicle
from the station, we were in hopes of finding comfortable
quarters in the hotel, but the wretchedness prevailing outside
seemed to have penetrated into every corner of <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>the
establishment.&nbsp; It was impossible to get anything hot to
eat, and the cold meats were most uninviting.&nbsp; The
proprietor, expecting another train in about an hour, deferred
serving even this cold cheer until its arrival.&nbsp; Meanwhile
nothing remained for us but to try to warm ourselves by pacing up
and down the scantily-furnished <i>salle a manger</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p261.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>We were glad to get to bed notwithstanding that the carpets in
the bedrooms were flapping in the wind in the most vigorous
manner during the night.</p>
<p><a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>On
rising next morning we found the storm had not abated, indeed it
continued with undiminished fury during the whole of our
stay.&nbsp; Our time, however, being limited, it was necessary to
disregard the weather in order to visit the scene of the recent
operations and the ruins of the city.&nbsp; On leaving the hotel
our dragoman of three years ago, Kalifa, at once recognised us,
and under his guidance we made a tour of the fortresses, going
first to Ras-el-Tin.&nbsp; We found the palace of that name,
which forms the landward boundary of the fortress, still
partially in ruins and apparently deserted.&nbsp; One could not
help feeling that the architect, in selecting such a site for a
royal residence, must have regarded the possibility of an attack
upon the fort from the sea as being too remote to be taken into
account.&nbsp; Some of the other forts had at one time stood
isolated from the town, but apparently it might be said of the
Alexandrians that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Exceeding peace had made them
bold,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for the approaches to the forts had gradually been built upon
until at length some of the houses were even erected against the
fortifications.&nbsp; These were the houses which were destroyed
during the bombardment, and the ruin of which gave rise to the
impression that the city itself had been shelled.&nbsp; All the
forts presented the same dismal aspect of ruin.&nbsp; Shattered
ramparts, battered casemates, huge holes in the walls of the
store-houses; the heavy Armstrong guns dismantled, some with the
muzzle pointed high up in the air, others lying on the ground; in
all cases the gun-carriages smashed and crushed into
shapelessness; burst shells, and heaps of stones and mortar lying
everywhere; great deep pits in <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>the ground, showing where an
&ldquo;Inflexible&rdquo; shell had burst.&nbsp; The buildings and
ramparts are of loosely-built stonework, hence wherever a shell
struck, it told with full and destructive effect.&nbsp; Here and
there one could see that a single shell had penetrated a rampart,
scattered the earth, upheaved a heavy Armstrong, and enveloped a
casemate in a heap of demolished masonry.&nbsp; In Fort A&iuml;da
an explosion, which wrecked the whole place, occurred early in
the action.&nbsp; In the whole of the forts there were Armstrong
guns of great calibre and of modern date.&nbsp; Their appearance
after the bombardment was most extraordinary: pieces knocked out
of the muzzles, huge slabs sheared out of their sides, and in
many cases the coils pitted with shot marks.&nbsp; In most
places, and at Fort Meks in particular, the muzzles were burst,
but this was the work of the landing parties shortly after the
action.&nbsp; There can be no question that the armament of these
forts was of a very formidable character, and that the condition
of the fleet after the encounter might have been a very serious
one had the guns throughout been well handled.</p>
<p>After leaving the Forts we went with a friend, long resident
in Alexandria, to Ramleh, the fashionable suburb of the
city.&nbsp; The word Ramleh means &ldquo;sand,&rdquo; and that
being so it may be said that no place was ever more appropriately
named.&nbsp; It is a mere sand waste by the shore, and its villas
are separated by sand wastes.&nbsp; The effect is somewhat
Australian, and the use of verandahs and Venetian shutters helps
the suggestion.&nbsp; Our friend&rsquo;s house was close to what
is known as Gun Hill, that is, where the 40-pounders were, and
from his Egyptian roof he could see Arabi&rsquo;s advanced
position <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>and the whole of the British camp.&nbsp; At 4 p.m.
every day it was the custom to go and see the practice from Gun
Hill.&nbsp; Mr. A.&rsquo;s house was open during the whole time,
and he told us it was for the most part more like a picnic than a
campaign.&nbsp; The officers, however, were frequently called
from his billiard table by an alarm from the camp, and on such
occasions Mr. A. had an understanding with them that should the
English be driven in they were to warn him when retreating past
his house by firing a volley through his windows!&nbsp; There
were of course times of great anxiety notwithstanding the
excitement and interest.</p>
<p>Mr. A. was in Alexandria during the massacre, and at the time
of the bombardment he was only away two days, being the first to
return to his house and live in it.&nbsp; While there, many of
the neighbouring houses were looted.&nbsp; His description of the
daily shooting of looters reminded one of the accounts of the
latter days of the Paris Commune.&nbsp; Mr. A.&rsquo;s garden is
ornamented with heavy English shells, which, he tells his
visitors, fell there&mdash;from a cart!</p>
<p>During the afternoon we had a stroll through the European
quarter of the city, and were amazed at the destruction to be
seen on every hand.&nbsp; The rows of fine houses, the shops, the
buildings of the Grand Square, the Place Mohammed Ali, with its
gardens, all a mass of unsightly ruins, from which workmen were
getting out the stones and stacking them up in long rows on the
footways.&nbsp; We had been pretty familiar with Alexandria, but
in the maze of ruined stonework we were completely at a loss and
could not find our way.&nbsp; Kalifa, however, came to our
assistance, and <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>guided by him we took a drive through the native
quarter, and soon perceived that, though the destruction by
incendiarism was unfortunately greatest in the European quarter,
the <i>petroleurs</i> had not spared their fellows, for many
native houses were burned.&nbsp; The extent to which property was
destroyed is incredible.&nbsp; There must be several miles of
streets in the sheerest ruin.&nbsp; The poor shopkeepers of the
Place Mohammed Ali now occupy temporary wooden shanties, and the
general aspect of this once gay and opulent quarter is wretched
in the extreme.</p>
<p>We next day paid a visit to Fort Meks, but except that its
armament was somewhat heavier than that of its fellows, there
were no new features to be seen.&nbsp; The same desolate
appearance of ruin and destruction&mdash;crippled gun-carriages,
burst guns, crumbling ramparts, and shell-ploughed ground.&nbsp;
This fort, from the accuracy of its gun practice, was the most
troublesome to the fleet.&nbsp; The five terrible
&ldquo;Armstrongs,&rdquo; however, lay burst and useless in the
sand drifts, with the rude and forgotten graves of the poor
gunners round about them.</p>
<p>A flood of misplaced eloquence has been expended in denouncing
the conduct of the British Government for having &ldquo;bombarded
and utterly destroyed a defenceless commercial city,&rdquo; and
the statement has been repeated so often as to be believed by
many; but I will venture to say that no one will for one moment
believe it who has had the opportunity, as I have, of being
conducted over the city and the fortifications by an intelligent
gentleman, an old resident, who was present during the whole of
the operations, and who <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>emphatically denies that the
bombardment of the forts caused any greater damage than I have
described.&nbsp; The charge has come mainly from the advocates of
peace; but it is a misfortune that such a sacred cause should be
damaged by gross exaggerations, and by statements which it is
impossible to sustain.&nbsp; The cause of peace, like the
temperance cause, has suffered greatly by this habit of
exaggeration.</p>
<p>At the <i>table d&rsquo;hote</i> I sat by an English officer
who had been in the thick of the fight at Kassassin, and who had
escaped unhurt; he did not seem inclined to say much about his
experiences on that terrible day, but he entertained a great
respect for the fighting capacity of the Egyptian soldier when
properly led.</p>
<p>During the whole of our stay in Alexandria the weather
continued to be extremely boisterous and very cold, and we were
glad to get on board the P. and O. steamer for Brindisi.&nbsp;
Some Anglo-Indians joined the vessel here, and we had an
opportunity of observing the way in which some of our countrymen
treat native races.</p>
<p>A crowd of Arabs in boats were alongside, offering their wares
to the passengers as they stepped up the side of the ship.&nbsp;
Amongst the rest there was a man with his little daughter
offering raw eggs, beads, shells, etc.&nbsp; Two of the
Anglo-Indians having bought a dozen of the eggs, and having
stationed themselves in a convenient position on deck, proceeded
to pelt the poor trader, completely spoiling his stock, and
covering him and his child with the contents of the
missiles.&nbsp; During the voyage these fellows also behaved in a
brutal manner towards the native stewards on board.&nbsp; <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>It is not
to be wondered at that men like these object to judicial powers
over Europeans being extended to natives, for it is probable that
under the operation of the Ilbert Bill they would stand a fair
chance of getting what they do not want&mdash;viz.,
justice.&nbsp; It is not difficult to imagine how such men would
act towards the natives if they were a thousand miles away from a
court having jurisdiction in cases of violence on the part of
Europeans against natives.</p>
<p>Stay-at-home folks in England usually think of the
Mediterranean as being calm as a lake, bathed in sunlight, and
blue as the famous grotto in the Island of Capri; but such has
not been my experience on the three occasions upon which I have
traversed its length.</p>
<p>Once, however, as we were leaving Alexandria, a very beautiful
phenomenon presented itself.&nbsp; The waters of the harbour were
of a dead pale sea-green while outside the bar the Mediterranean
was of an intense, opalescent, turquoise-blue, so exquisitely
beautiful that the attention of the whole ship&rsquo;s company
was directed upon it.&nbsp; We presently crossed the bar and
dipped right into this extraordinary colour.&nbsp; The line of
demarcation was clear and sharp, and lay just outside the
harbour.</p>
<p>On reaching the open sea we encountered a furious gale, which
continued with varying intensity until our arrival off Brindisi
four days afterwards&mdash;twenty-four hours after time.&nbsp;
The sea, which had been running high during the whole voyage,
made a clean breach of the bridge on the last evening,
necessitating the bringing of the vessel&rsquo;s head to the wind
and &ldquo;lying-to&rdquo; for the night.</p>
<p><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>On
arrival off the entrance to the harbour no pilot was forthcoming,
and it began to be whispered that we should not be permitted to
land without undergoing quarantine; but happily our fears proved
to be groundless, and the captain having run up a signal
informing the port authorities of his intention to go in without
a pilot, we were soon alongside, and on European soil once
again.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
